# Validation & Value Attribution

## Incentive Framework

The Ethereum Attestation Service lays the groundwork for our incentive mechanism. Each attestation becomes part of the computation determining value attribution and reward distribution.&#x20;

> EAS ensures a transparent and fair system where contributors of Engrams are rewarded based on actual utility and demand in the ecosystem. You can see more about this here: [https://attest.sh/](https://attest.sh/)

The use of EAS within the PoK protocol forms a trustworthy and secure system for validating knowledge contributions and rewarding contributors. It answers the call for a distributed, transparent, and reliable method to authenticate, validate, and incentivize meaningful engagements in a decentralized knowledge ecosystem.

## Optimising for Coherence

When optimizing for coherence in the Proof-of-Knowledge (PoK) concept, there are several important aspects to consider. 

Firstly, coherence ensures that the Engrams (units of knowledge) contain logically consistent and well-structured information. The goal here is to ensure that each Engram has a clear, homogeneous narrative that not only makes sense but also effectively answers the queries deemed by users.

This process is thought of at two levels:

1. **Local Coherence**: This refers to the cohesion and connectivity within a single Engram. It involves ensuring each unit of knowledge in an Engram is internally consistent and logically connected with the others. This helps to improve the comprehension and interpretation of the individual Engram.

2. **Global Coherence**: Global coherence extends beyond individual Engrams. It includes the logical connection and relationships between different Engrams within the Knowledge Graph. Therefore, it not only focuses on the intra-Engram relationships but also on the inter-Engram connections. This helps create a globally coherent embedding space, crucial for developing Knowledge Graphs.

There are a variety of strategies to enhance coherence in both local and global perspectives. One way to maintain local coherence is to develop focused Engrams, centred around specific topics or queries. This helps to improve the internal consistency of the Engram. 

For improving global coherence, related Engrams can be cross-referenced. This helps to create a network of related knowledge, thus adding depth and breadth to the overall knowledge representation. 

User interactions also play an essential role in maintaining and enhancing coherence. Feedback from users can be a powerful tool to refine and update the information in the Engram, making it more coherent over time. This user-led learning and updating process helps to create a dynamic, interconnected hub of collective knowledge, which is the heart of the PoK mechanism.

In conclusion, optimizing coherence in the PoK system is key to creating an effective and useful knowledge-based ecosystem. It involves a continuous process of learning, adaptation, and evolution with a focus on nurturing the most relevant, coherent, and valuable knowledge.
## "Validation" of Knowledge

The validation process within the DeSciWorld PoK ecosystem operates as an emergent property of a free market of knowledge. It is an unconstrained arena where diverse viewpoints vie for relevancy, encouraging a robust, dynamic interplay of ideas and perspectives.&#x20;

Unlike conventional, centralized validation systems, _this decentralized model_ does not pre-emptively adjudicate or prioritize one piece of knowledge over another. Instead, the relevancy of each Engram or Study Question (SQ) is determined organically through its usage and demand within the ecosystem.&#x20;

In this free market of knowledge, each Engram competes for attention and usage. The merit of an Engram is not determined by a unilateral authority but through its actual utility and effectiveness in satisfying a user's query or task. Engrams that demonstrate persistent usefulness and applicability over time, as judged through the unbiased lens of Language Learning Models (LLMs), accrue higher relevancy scores.&#x20;

This competitive and responsive environment ensures that the validation process is continuously refined and realigned according to the evolving needs and preferences of users. It overcomes inherent biases and silos, fostering a system where the best, most useful, and most relevant knowledge prospers.&#x20;

In essence, within the DeSciWorld model, validation isn't a one-time stamp of approval but a continuous process of adaptation, adjustment, and evolution â€” a dynamic reflection of a knowledge unit's continuous performance in the marketplace of ideas and information.&#x20;
