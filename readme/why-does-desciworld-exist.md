# Why does DeSciWorld exist?

We are in a time of converging technologies. Many decades of breakneck innovation in the fields of chemistry, biotechnology, computer science, AI, telecommunications, epistemology, philosphy, space travel and more have begun to converge in a manner that frightens many, and excites more still.

With this landscape of immense technological power laid before us, humanity has a newfound responsibility to guide itself responsibly. What responsible stewarship entails differs depending on who you ask, but one thing is certain: centralised and monolithic institutions alone do not posses the right to determine the future of humanity.&#x20;

DeSciWorld was created in September 2021, after the COVID pandemic exposed some fundamental concerns with the scientific paradigm: censorship, bias, illicit public-private partnerships, profiteering, inefficiencies, uninformed populations, uneven distribution of data and medicine, to name a few.

These problems are not new. The state and the scientific establishment have a long and intimate history. The priesthood of Egypt maintained close control of the sacred knowledge of reading and mathematics; only they could interpret the unseen machinations of the deity (knowledge) that directed the Pharaoh's world. The church once forbade evidence that showed proof of heliocentricism. In many parts of the world, posession of vital fungal medicine is still a criminal offense punishable by death.&#x20;

We detest the censorship and dogmatic resistance to new ideas that is present today. This is most prevalent in politics and media but has deep roots in science. The scientific method was created for this very reason. The ability for a hypothesis to be posed, in the open, such that it can be debated and tested led the way to the Enlightenment Era - an unprecedented period of innovation both technologically and socially.&#x20;

However, even the Judeo-Chrisitan scientific materialism discoveries have their limitations; our most treasured and fundamental understanding of the universe is based on premises occasionally _break_ under intense scrutiny. Many ancient communities claim knowledge of the unknown, yet without the  empirical evidence this is dismissed without further investigation.

But how, I wonder, can we ever make breakthrough discoveries if we presume omniscience?

Now, more than ever before in our species' history, we must answer the toughest questions: What does it mean to be a human? Who has the right to make decisions for others? What does a successful life look like? What does a _good life_ look like? We have come far in our understandings of the universe, but we are young as a species and do not have all the answers.&#x20;

Handing the right to determination of the future of humanity, the keys to the ignition of tools of destruction, the honour of shepharding the great masses of the world to _**any one entity**_ is a folly. We must create the tools that decentralise and distribute the power that is afforded to technology, before control of those tools is absolute.

The world of science has had many moments of drastic change; there have been both dark ages and enlightened ages. We need not be led into the an age of ignorance, fear and control. With decentralised knowledge creation, dissemination and incentivisation, we hope DeSciWorld can act as fulcrum to the decentralised renaissance of knowledge.
