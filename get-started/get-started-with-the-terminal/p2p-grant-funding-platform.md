# P2P Grant funding platform

The DeSciWorld peer-to-peer (P2P) platform is designed to connect researchers, scientists and experts to decentralized funding channels.

As a P2P marketplace, this platform facilitates trade between two or more private individuals. The decentralized transaction infrastructure of Web3 and blockchain allows researchers and funders to connect without the need for a centralized mediator. The DeSciWorld marketplace is trustless and transparent.

All users must sign up to the platform using either a public or anonymous profile; this profile receives reputation points based on a number of factors, still to be defined. This reputation, combined with smart contract-enabled escrow, allows our users to interact confidently with each other independent of trust.
