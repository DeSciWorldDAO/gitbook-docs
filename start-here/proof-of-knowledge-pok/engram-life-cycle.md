# Engram Life-cycle

The life-cycle of an Engram is a dynamic and multi-faceted process, marked by several steps: its composition, addition of value, utilization, and evolution over time. Here's a general overview of the process:

### Composition&#x20;

The life-cycle of an Engram begins with its composition. Typically, a group or an individual creates an Engram by compiling pertinent information around a specific topic or query. This information, commonly referred to as 'data', is then structured and organized within the engram to establish the shape and contents of the knowledge unit which then get submitted using the Ethereum Attestation Protocol (EAP).

### Addition of Value

Once a kEngram has been formed, it can be further enriched and enhanced by other groups or individuals who add their own knowledge and insights to it. They can integrate additional data, revise existing information, or link the kEngram to other related kEngram within the Knowledge Graph. This collaborative process of knowledge amplification adds a multi-dimensional depth of understanding to the kEngram, enhancing its value.

### Utilization & Evolution&#x20;

Engrams, once submitted, are then available for use. They are identified and selected by AI interfaces based on their relevance to specific queries or tasks. The frequency, context, and nature of how these Engrams are utilized play a crucial role in determining their ongoing validation scores and their corresponding value within the knowledge market.
