# Terminal

1. Onboarding and connecting to DeSci to raise their profile&#x20;
2. Showcase their protocol
3. Keep up to date with DeSci events&#x20;
4. Access a gateway to open funding

> "In essence, the Terminal acts as the nerve center for the global DeSci community, bridging the gap between research, collaboration, and technology. The terminal enables the open source nature of decentralized science by considering the research community as key users of the platform, providing tooling to let the DeScienists flourish. We believe this paves the way for a more integrated and holistic research paradigm."&#x20;
