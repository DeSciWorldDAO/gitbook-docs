# Terminal

The DeSci Dashboard aggregates information from across the world of decentralised science

Created to be a central hub of DeSci, desci.world is dedicated to fostering engagement, collaboration, and education within the global community.

Designed with the DeScientist in mind the DeSciWorld Dashboard enables independent scientists and research groups to build their profiles and connect with the DeSci ecosystem by:

Desci.world features a suite of functionality created to help DeScientists:&#x20;

1. The Terminal has been designed to enable the global DeSci Community to flourish and enable DeScientists.&#x20;
2. The Public Funding Market connects DeScientists to Open Research projects, alongside a secure and transparent smart contract escrow to access research funding.
3. Spotlight features an overview of the DeSci ecosystem and the ability to list your dApp.

2. Showcase their protocol
3. Keep up to date with DeSci events
4. Access a gateway to open funding

> "In essence, the Terminal acts as the nerve center for the global DeSci community, bridging the gap between research, collaboration, and technology. The terminal enables the open source nature of decentralized science by considering the research community as key users of the platform, providing tooling to let the DeScienists flourish. We believe this paves the way for a more integrated and holistic research paradigm."

With the above in mind the terminal has a range of features that have been created to enable the success of the DeScientist and connect them to Open Research.

The DeSciWorld Dashboard is a free-to-use online information hub that aggregates and displays information about DeSci projects in an easily digestible format. We aim for it to become a primary resource for learning about all that DeSci has to offer. It allows researchers/academics/VCs/non-scientists to obtain information about all DeSci-relevant projects. Scientists / DeSciDAOs / other people related to DeSci can also expand outreach for their work, grow networks, access resources from a huge and growing community and even apply for funding.

Project pages display relevant information about individual DeSci projects, such as information about tokens and governance proposals, media embeds, short descriptions and relevant links. These pages allow users to get a quick overview of a project before fully diving into their community.
