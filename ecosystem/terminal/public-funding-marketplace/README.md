# Public Funding Marketplace

Consider that research processes are:\
\
\- Difficult to obtain funding for\
\- Lack transparency \
\- Has challenges with global co-ordination&#x20;

The DSW P2P Funding Marketplace has been designed to allow any researchers, regardless of their affiliations or experience, to present their project ideas to a global community of potential funders. The platform removes bureaucratic hurdles, accelerates scientific research funding, and ensures a fair and efficient funding process for all parties involved by ensure transparency at every step.&#x20;

### Leverage the blockchain to deliver Open Research

The marketplace utilizes a smart contract based escrow system alongside a novel on-chain reputation mechanism. This setup allows research to be funded independently or even anonymously, providing flexibility and inclusivity for both funding parties and researchers.
