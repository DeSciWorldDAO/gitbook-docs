# Microbes NFT

## **The Collection**

**Microbes** is our debut NFT collection. Together with friends from [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/232035/boosted-economy-decentralised-science-news-from/), images of real PhD microbiology research were gathered and artistically rendered to create this collection.

### Traits and Rarity <a href="#b461" id="b461"></a>

‚ÄúMicrobes‚Äù contains 999 heterogenous pieces of art in three core categories:

* 444 üß´ Bacteria
* 333 üçÑ Funghi
* 222 ü¶† Virus

Alongside these three principle categories, there are also a number of traits that provide additional rarity distinctions for your NFT, such as:

* Biosafety Level (i.e. BSL1, BSL4)
* Movement (i.e. spin, burst)
* Assembly (i.e. particle, protein)
* Magnification (i.e. atomic, 63x)

These characteristics help to define each piece within the collection whilst also giving the viewer a deeper understanding of what analysis researchers use when interacting with their data.

181 of the 999 Microbes NFTs contain some form of unlockable content. The unlockable content ranges from source imaging (pre-manipulation), reports and even raw imagery data such as this:

## Background

{% hint style="info" %}
The Microbes NFT was created by a private entity, outside of the DeSciWorld DAO. Thus, the DAO has no control over the proceeds of the sale. Ostensibly, the funds are used to assist in the initial bootstrapping phase of the DAO‚Äôs existence. Further, Microbes has a 5% royalty fee on all sales.
{% endhint %}

The Microbes NFT [contracts](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x61c300639534a3cba4c73b515f185ef54ac32e2a74fe509f6317833bd4fc1227) were deployed November 15th 2021 with the intention of funding development for the project that became DeSciWorld. Created outside of the DeSciWorld DAO‚Äôs jurisdiction, Microbes sales have been used by DeSciWorld to fund operations in the bootstrapping phase of the protocol's growth.&#x20;

DeSciWorld posted a [Medium article](https://medium.com/desciworld/launch-day-microbes-nft-a9ecc0d1d61e) explaining the Microbes NFT and its potential future use cases in 2021. Some of these stated potentialities are no longer relevant.&#x20;
