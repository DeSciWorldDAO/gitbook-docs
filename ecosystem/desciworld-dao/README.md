DSW DAO has three core objectives as guiding principles:

1. Develop products and tools that unlock the potential of open research
2. Support the development of the DeSci Ecosystem
3. Grow the DeSci community&#x20;

To deliver this objective contributors to the DAO will have the skills to able to work towards these objectives. Considering these further helps understand why DeSciWorld organizes as a decentralized organization.&#x20;

### The role between the DSW DAO and [science.tech](http://science.tech)

Science.tech will provide an open-governance mechanism that oversees the operational factors around open science (DeSci). Understanding the DSW DAO as a facilitator of DeSci makes for a better appreciation of the DAO's purpose, as well as how the DAO will ensure the success of science.tech. You can consider science.tech an incubated platform by the DSW DAO.&#x20;
