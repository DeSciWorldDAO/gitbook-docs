# Installation Setup

#### 2.1 Understanding the Role of Obsidian

Obsidian is a powerful knowledge base that works on top of a local folder of plain text Markdown files. The main advantage of Obsidian is its ability to create "links" between your notes, giving you a way to seamlessly navigate through your personal knowledge base and visualize connections between different pieces of information.

#### 2.2 Installation Steps

The installation process for Obsidian is straightforward:

1. Begin by visiting the Obsidian official website [here](https://obsidian.md/).
2. Click on the 'Download' button, which will take you to the download page.
3. Here, select the version of Obsidian that corresponds to your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
4. After the installer is downloaded, locate the file and open it to begin the installation.
5. Follow the installation instructions provided by the setup wizard.
6. After completing the installation process, launch Obsidian.

#### 2.3 Setting Up Your First Vault

In Obsidian, a 'Vault' is like a workspace. It’s essentially a folder on your computer where your notes will be stored. Here's how to set one up:

1. After launching Obsidian, you’ll be prompted to open your vault. If you’re a first-time user, select "Create a new vault."
   1. The [kEngram\_starter\_kit.zip](https://github.com/DeSciWorldDAO/gitbook-docs/files/13799400/kEngram\_starter\_kit.zip) (once extracted) can be selected as a vault containing all required plugins and templates
2. Next, give your new vault a name and choose its location on your computer.
3. Once you've done that, click 'Create' to finish setting up your vault.

#### 2.4 Understanding Obsidian Interface and Basic Functionality

The Obsidian interface is divided into several parts. It may seem overwhelming at first, but it’s fairly straightforward to use:

* **File Explorer:** This is where you can view and navigate through all the notes in your vault. You can create new notes, delete existing ones, and organize notes into folders.
* **Edit and Preview Modes:** You can switch between edit mode (for writing or modifying a note) and preview mode (for viewing the note).
* **Backlinks Pane:** This pane shows you all the notes in your vault that link back to the current note.
* **Graph View:** This feature visualizes all the notes in your vault and the connections between them.

To create new notes, simply click on the 'New note' icon on the file explorer. You can then start typing in the Edit mode. To make links between notes, you can leverage the double bracket `[[ ]]` syntax. For example, you can type `[[Note B]]` in Note A, to create a link from Note A to Note B.

#### 2.5 Installing Plugins

Plugins are a great way to extend the functionality of Obsidian. Obsidian has a variety of community plugins that you can utilize:

1. Open the Settings by clicking on the gear icon at the bottom of the left sidebar.
2. Navigate to the 'Community plugins' under 'Plugin options'.
3. Click 'Browse'.
4. You will now see a list of community plugins that you can search through, install, and enable.
   1. Engram-relevant plugin list (Included in [kEngram\_starter\_kit.zip](https://github.com/DeSciWorldDAO/gitbook-docs/files/13799402/kEngram\_starter\_kit.zip) )
      1. Chat Stream:
      2. Smart Connections:
      3. Link Exploder
      4. MAKE.md
      5. Surfing

Remember to always verify the credibility and safety of the plugins before installing them, given that plugins often have deep access to Obsidian's functionality.

This wraps up your basic setup. You're now ready to create your first engram!
