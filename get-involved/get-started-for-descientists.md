# Researchers

Designed with the DeScientist in mind the DSW Terminal enables independent scientists to build their profiles and connect with the DeSci ecosystem. DeSciWorld's Terminal enables the DeScientist to:

1. Onboard and connect to DeSci
2. Raise their profile&#x20;
3. Showcase previous research projects&#x20;
4. Keep up to date with DeSci events&#x20;
5. Have a gateway to open funding

With the above in mind the terminal has a range of features that have been created to enable the success of the DeScientist and connect them to Open Research.

## Researchers&#x20;

Researchers that are passionate in a field that is not _en vogue_ often struggle to source contributions towards their early-stage research. DeSciWorld understands this challenge and seeks to support researchers with a plethora of tools to overcome this high first hurdle. Ultimately we want to foster a strong ecosystem of open researchers to progress under-researched fields of science.
