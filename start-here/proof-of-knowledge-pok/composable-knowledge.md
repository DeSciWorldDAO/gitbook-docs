As the kEngram continues to be used among a global network of AI interfaces, each interaction and usage is also documented. These records contribute to an Engram's ongoing validation in our ecosystem. This evidence-based approach ensures that each Engram's relevance, accuracy, and utility are continuously verified, evaluated, and updated.&#x20;
