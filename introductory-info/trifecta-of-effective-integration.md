# The Vision

The future of knowledge and understanding is at risk of extreme, parasitic corporatisation. Our roles as workers in society is also changing rapidly; automation is sweeping through the service economy.&#x20;

The team and partners at DeSciWorld believe in a better incentivised and more democratised future of knowledge creation and exchange. With the progress in AI systems, knowledge and its author may become seperated irretrievably. The data we produce informs inteliigent systems operating for profit and can be used in research without attribution. We deserve our share.

## Knowledge Backed Economy

In a bid to achieve the truly distributed scientific community that Decentralised Science dreams of, we must bring the tools to the people who need them.

### Students <a href="#ea99" id="ea99"></a>

Students are the lifeblood of science. Young, passionate and often wonderfully optimistic, we believe that the most powerful and revolutionary ideas will come from this group. On the one hand students tend to have less vested interest in continuing the encumbency of the status quo — the system has caused many issues in the world that they must now tackle. On the other hand, students have less to lose and are more willing to take calculated risks. DeSci is primed for their adoption.

### Academia <a href="#e8d3" id="e8d3"></a>

Academic societies dictate the direction of the populations as their research and recommendations influence policy at all levels. Think tanks are the sages of old. It is essential that the DeSci community demonstrates to these powerful substrates that decentralisation and the redistributive potential that comes with it is the best method to cure the ills that we face today. In order to influence policy, we must enlighten policymakers.

### Industry <a href="#id-2e3c" id="id-2e3c"></a>

Finally, the theoretical underpinning of students and academia wont achieve much without the practical applications of industry. The trend of the last century is for competent scientists to go where they receive the best compensation — Western scientific industry. Indian doctors go to Europe, African pharmacists go to Big Pharma, South American chemists do their research in the US. This has invariably left local research communities lacking in both talent and funding. A deadly cycle that can only be broken by brave individuals creating value in their own lands. DeSci can be a core toolset to empower local industry, who in turn can compete with the global scientific industry.
