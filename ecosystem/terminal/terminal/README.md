# Terminal

> In essence, the Terminal acts as the nerve center for the global DeSci community, bridging the gap between research, collaboration, and technology. The terminal enables the open source nature of decentralized science by considering the research community as key users of the platform, providing tooling to let the DeScienists flourish. We believe this paves the way for a more integrated and holistic research paradigm.

By providing a platform for DeScientists to showcase their projects and build comprehensive profiles, the Terminal serves as a pivotal tool for overcoming obstacles in the research landscape. More than just a facilitator for scientists, the features within the Terminal acts as a gateway to the broader DeSci space.

Terminal:&#x20;

1. **Spotlight Your Project**: A curated list of ongoing and upcoming research projects within the DeSci ecosystem. Users can browse, join, or contribute to these initiatives.
2. **Funding NFT Listings**: A marketplace for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) related to research findings, articles, and innovations. This allows for the monetization and recognition of unique research contributions in the DeSci space.
3. **Ecosystem Jobs Board**: A listing of job opportunities within the DeSci ecosystem, catering to various skill sets and expertise levels.
4. **Events Calendar**: A comprehensive calendar detailing events, webinars, meet-ups, and conferences relevant to the DeSci community. This feature ensures users never miss out on significant happenings in the realm of decentralized science.

Overall the terminal provides an avenue for researchers to showcase their work, engage with peers, and gain recognition from the global community. Explore more of the functionality below:&#x20;
