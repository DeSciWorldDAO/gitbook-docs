# RC

## Overview

The open science movement has long advocated for distributed communities to collaborate on research, to share their knowledge more widely with other groups and to self-organise around sovereign treasuries. As the technology of DLT, tokenised assets and deAI has progressed, it is finally time for these structures to take effect.

Members of the Research Collectives can autonomously govern themselves via the subDAO infrastructure. They may create and index kEngrams, uniting them in a coherent repository of collective research, leverage on-chain assets, participate in token-weighted governance and more - with minimal prior experience or resources.

This collective acts as a hub for researchers to combine their knowledge, compare notes, collaborate on shared topics of interest, and contribute to the body of research within that specific area.

## Onchain Tooling

## kEngram Indexing

## Collective Governance

The collective is overseen by its contributing researchers. Its expansion is facilitated by the addition of new kEngrams by both existing and new researchers and management of its treasury using token governance.

## Create your own Research Collective

## Joining a Research Collective&#x20;

Researchers can join collectives that align with their interests or expertise, contributing their unique perspectives and research to the collectiveâ€™s knowledge base.

## Growing your Research Collective

Management and Expansion of RC

Researchers can also leverage the resources provided by DeSciWorld, including collaborative tools, validation services, and communication platforms to enhance their research efforts.

## Monetization of Research

As Pok rewards knowledge contributions within the DeSciWorld ecosystem, this also applies to the research shared within Research Collectives.&#x20;

* As the kEngrams within a collective are used and referenced within DeSciWorld, the creators of these kEngrams receive $KNOW tokens as rewards.
* This system incentivizes the creation and distribution of high-quality research, providing a revenue stream to researchers while enhancing the overall quality of Research Collectives.
* Indexing&#x20;
