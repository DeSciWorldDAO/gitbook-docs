#### Instead of accuracy as the defining factor of kEngrams, we optimise for coherence.

Coherence ensures that the kEngrams contain logically consistent and well-structured information; a clear, homogeneous narrative between the Question and the Answer. This helps to ensure that the kEngram not only makes sense but also can be efficiently queried by AI services.

This process is thought of at two levels:

1. **Local Coherence**: This refers to the cohesion and connectivity within a single kEngram. It involves ensuring each addition to a kEngram is internally consistent and logically connected with the others. This helps to improve the comprehension and interpretation of the individual kEngram.
   * One method to maintain local coherence is to develop focused kEngrams, centred around specific Study Questions or queries.&#x20;
2. **Global Coherence**: Global coherence extends beyond individual kEngrams. It includes the logical connection and relationships between different kEngrams within different Brains. Therefore, it not only focuses on the intra-kEngram relationships but also on the inter-kEngram connections. This helps create a globally coherent embedding space, crucial for developing Decentralised Knowledge Graphs.
   * To improve global coherence, related kEngrams can be cross-referenced. This helps to create a network of related knowledge, thus adding depth and breadth to the overall knowledge representation.

## Coherence Engineering

There are a variety of strategies to enhance coherence in both local and global perspectives. We anticipate whole schools of thought dedicated to understanding and optimising for coherence will emerge in response to this protocol.

User interactions also play an essential role in maintaining and enhancing coherence. Feedback from users can be a powerful tool to refine and update the information in the kEngram, making it more coherent over time. This user-led learning and updating process helps to create a dynamic, interconnected hub of collective knowledge, which is the heart of the PoK mechanism.

In conclusion, optimizing coherence in the PoK system is key to creating an effective and useful knowledge-based ecosystem. It involves a continuous process of learning, adaptation, and evolution with a focus on nurturing the most relevant, coherent, and valuable knowledge.
