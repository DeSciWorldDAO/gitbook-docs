# Validation & Value Attribution

Validation within the PoK protocol operates as an emergent property of a <mark style="color:green;">free market of knowledge</mark>. Usage metrics, combined with other continously updating feedbacks, determine the validity and value of the knowledge in a market-based model.

In essence, within the DeSciWorld model, validation isn't a one-time stamp of approval but a continuous process of adaptation, adjustment, and evolution â€” a dynamic reflection of a knowledge unit's continuous performance in the marketplace of ideas and information, that simultaneously helps to determine its value.

## Tracking Usage Metrics

The Ethereum Attestation Service lays the groundwork for our usage tracking mechanism.

## "Validation" of Knowledge

In this free market of knowledge, each kEngram competes for attention and usage. As the kEngram continues to be queried by a global network of AI interfaces, each interaction and usage is documented. These records contribute to an kEngram's ongoing validation in our ecosystem.&#x20;

Unlike conventional, centralized validation systems, _this decentralized model_ does not pre-emptively adjudicate or prioritize one piece of knowledge over another. Instead, the relevancy of each kEngram is determined organically through its usage and demand within the ecosystem.

This evidence-based approach ensures that each kEngram's relevance, coherence, and utility are continuously verified, evaluated, and updated. It overcomes inherent biases and silos, fostering a system where the best, most useful, and most relevant knowledge prospers.
