# desci.world

As an agnostic and unbiased repository for all things decentralised science, we consider this platform a public good for the DeSci community. We aim to engage the growing base of potential (de)scientists, so that they might be inspired to contribute to the mindshare.

At desci.world, you can engage with:

<summary><a href="broken-reference">Terminal</a> - information aggregation dashboard</summary>

An information aggregation hub, drawing from available information across the DeSci space. The Terminal contains the following aggregated information:

* Project repository
* Job Board
* Events Calendar
* Interactive Map
* Media and Resources
* Tooling / Apps
* Decentralised Funding Opportunities

The Terminal allows researchers/academics/VCs/non-scientists to obtain information about all DeSci-relevant projects. Scientists / DeSciDAOs / other people related to DeSci can also expand outreach for their work, grow networks, access resources from a huge and growing community and even apply for funding.

We aim for it to become a primary resource for learning about all that DeSci has to offer.

The NFT marketplace is to be powered by [Rarible](https://rarible.com/).
