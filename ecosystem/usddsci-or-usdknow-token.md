The $KNOW token primarily facilitates governance of the DeSciWorld DAO. Some potential token utilities, the implementation of which is to decided by the pre-DAO, are listed below:&#x20;

### <mark style="color:blue;">$veDSCI</mark>

The $DSCI token could be staked to earn $veDSCI. The $veDSCI token is a model that incentivises long-term ecosystem participants by emitting on a linear scale over 3 years, which resets upon unstaking. $veDSCI is used to govern the DeSciWorld DAO, meaning that only those who stake $DSCI have governance power. This ensures that those with the longest term commitment have the most say in protocol governance.

### <mark style="color:blue;">$veDSCI Mechanics</mark>&#x20;

$veDSCI starts accumulating the next epoch after a user has staked their $DSCI Tokens. It accumulates at a rate of 1/156 per $DSCI Token, per week (one epoch is one week) and maxes out at 1 per staked $DSCI Token.

Staking additional $DSCI Tokens increases the $veDSCI received in the next epoch after staking and does not reset the $veDSCI counter. A user is free to stake additional $DSCI tokens whenever they desire.

Users are free to withdraw their $DSCI stake at any given point in time, however, withdrawing any amount of staked $DSCI will reset the accumulated amount of $veDSCI back to zero.&#x20;

### <mark style="color:blue;">Revenue Sharing Staking</mark>&#x20;

$DSCI could also allow $veDSCI holders to receive a share of any potential revenues accrued by the DeSciWorld platform. This Revenue Stream, which is garnered from DeSciWorld’s products.

### <mark style="color:blue;">Discount on in-app Purchases</mark>&#x20;

$DSCI may also be used in a variety of cases instead of standard payment tokens (stablecoins or $ETH, for example) to receive discounts on purchase prices. Merchandise, event tickets, payment for “CaaS”, exclusive media content, NFT sales etc. may all feature.
