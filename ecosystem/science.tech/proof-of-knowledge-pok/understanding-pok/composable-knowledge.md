# Composable Knowledge

## Compasability

Composability is akin to building with LEGO bricks. Web3 is infamous for building an interoperable stack: components with a specific usecase that can be combined with others to create entirely new products. This concept is what drives the standardisation of EVM infrastructures.

In the PoK system we have two types of compasbilty:

1. **Compasable Knowledge Units**: The kEngram unit itself can be considered as a part of the "DeSci stack"; designed so that it can be incorporated with other DeSci projects as a data input.
2. **Composable Knowledge**: Each piece of knowledge, or more precisely, each [attestation](composable-knowledge.md#attestations), can stand alone but, when combined, they form a more complex and intricate structure to the benefit of the research.&#x20;

## Attestations

The Ethereum Attestation Service lays the groundwork for our incentive mechanism. Each attestation becomes part of the computation determining value attribution and reward distribution.

> EAS ensures a transparent and fair system where contributors of Engrams are rewarded based on actual utility and demand in the ecosystem. You can see more about this here: [https://attest.sh/](https://attest.sh/)

The use of EAS within the PoK protocol forms a trustworthy and secure system for validating knowledge contributions and rewarding contributors. It answers the call for a distributed, transparent, and reliable method to authenticate, validate, and incentivize meaningful engagements in a decentralized knowledge ecosystem.

## Composable with:

#### AI Services

As the kEngram continues to be used among a global network of AI interfaces, each interaction and usage is also documented. These records contribute to an Engram's ongoing validation in our ecosystem. This evidence-based approach ensures that each Engram's relevance, accuracy, and utility are continuously verified, evaluated, and updated.&#x20;
