### Pok - a Proof-of-Knowledge protocol

Pok is an advanced AI-based search system that offers a brand new method to quantify and value knowledge - the [kEngram](kengrams.md) (kE). kE are an onchain data object that both maintains an unbreakable chain of provenance and tracks its usage by AI within the [knowledge market](knowledge-market.md). Usage of kE is to be incentivised with the [$KNOW](../usddsci-or-usdknow-token.md) token.

Pok utilises a cryptographic proof that [attests](kengrams.md#attestation-framework) to the creation of an [kEngram](kengrams.md). kE are organised into indexes of knowledge called [Brains](brains.md). The index system is used to maintain an updated embedding set which can Pok can use to locate specific kEngrams as per query requirements. Each substantial interaction with a kE sends usage data to Pok which can be used to determine incentives, in a system we coin the "[Knowledge Market](knowledge-market.md)".

As a fundamental building block towards a fully-fledged [knowledge-backed economy](../../introductory-info/trifecta-of-effective-integration.md), the Pok protocol offers a comprehensive framework to fuel intellectual contribution and foster an environment of continuous learning and knowledge exchange.
