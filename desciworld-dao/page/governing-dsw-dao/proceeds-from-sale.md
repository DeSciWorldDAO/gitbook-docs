# Proceeds from sale

The Microbes NFT was created by a private entity, outside of the DeSciWorld DAO. Thus, the DAO has no control over the proceeds of the sale. Ostensibly, the funds are used to assist in the initial bootstrapping phase of the DAOâ€™s existence. Further, Microbes has a 5% royalty fee on all sales.
