# Get started with DeSciWorld DAO

DeSciWorld DAO has been established to nurture and support the three fundamental pillars that form the backbone of Decentralised Science: Community, Researchers, and Protocols. Through organizing as a DAO DeSciWorld hopes to engage all participants in DeSci to further the space. From our current observations we see there to be three core&#x20;

## Researchers&#x20;

Researchers that are passionate in a field that is not _en vogue_ often struggle to source contributions towards their early-stage research. DeSciWorld understands this challenge and seeks to support researchers with a plethora of tools to overcome this high first hurdle. Ultimately we want to foster a strong ecosystem of open researchers to progress under-researched fields of science.

## Protocols&#x20;

The skilled hands of Decentralised Science have created a range of successful DeSci protocols. These can be referenced within the Terminal, one of the many tools that DeSciWorld provide to protocols whether just starting out or established.&#x20;
