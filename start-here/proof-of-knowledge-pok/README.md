  Proof of Knowledge (PoK) Is a cryptographic proof that attests to the creation
  of an kEngram, which is a digital representation of a unit of knowledge.

### The Proof of Knowledge Protocol

Through the Proof of Knowledge (PoK) protocol, we provide an on-chain container for knowledge, interoperable with the burdgeoning "DeSci stack". PoK offers a brand new method to quantify and value knowledge - the [kEngram](kengrams.md) (kE). kE are a data object that both maintains an unbreakable chain of provenance and[ tracks its usage within the knowledge market](validation-and-value-attribution.md). Usage of kE is to be incentivised with the $DSCI/KNOW token.

As a fundamental building block towards a fully-fledged knowledge-backed economy, the PoK protocol offers a comprehensive framework to fuel intellectual contribution and foster an environment of continuous learning and knowledge exchange.

The Proof of Knowledge (PoK) protocol is built around the [attestation](https://docs.attest.sh/docs/core--concepts/attestations) of kEngrams (kE). kEngrams are designed as a blockchain-based primitive aimed to incentivize and reward knowledge contributions within a _decentralized architecture._&#x20;

They serve as the core building block of a globally coherent knowledge graph which can be the primary means of value creation of a knowledge-based economy, paving the way for fair recognition and incentivization of intellectual contributions, while maintaining transparency and accessibility.
