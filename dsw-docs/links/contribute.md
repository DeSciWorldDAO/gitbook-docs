# Contribute

**Why contribute?**

Members that add value to the ecosystem are the most precious resource that we have and we want to nurture and support anyone that can meaningfully contribute to DeSciWorld.

We are experimenting with a variety of incentive mechanisms to attract, retain and reward those that help us on our journey. Stay tuned for more details on this.

**Who can contribute?**

Seriously, anyone with a keen attitude and an internet connection can become a valuable member of the DeSciWorld community and, potentially, the team. There are countless stories of people that originally had no skills or connections within the blockchain space and found a role in a project's community.
