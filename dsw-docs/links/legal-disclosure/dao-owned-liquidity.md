# DAO-Owned liquidity

Under proposed measures, the DeSciWorld pre-DAO may vote to launch 100% of the $DSCI token supply onto Uniswap v2 coupled with a determined amount of $USDC or $ETH in liquidity pairing.&#x20;

The DeSciWorld DAO would then own the UNI-V2 LP token that is issued upon formation of a Liquidity Pool. This LP would represent the initial amount of $DSCI / $\[funding token] that was deployed to Uniswap v2 and will be locked for an amount of time determined by the DAO.
