# Terminal

Acting as a central hub for various functionalities, the terminal ensures a seamless and efficient interface for DeScientists, research commissioners, and others curious about the DeSci ecosystem. The DSW Terminal has been designed to enable the global DeSci Community to flourish. 

### Functionalities:

1. **Project Listings Page**: A curated list of ongoing and upcoming research projects within the DeSci ecosystem. Users can browse, join, or contribute to these initiatives.
2. **Events Calendar**: A comprehensive calendar detailing events, webinars, meet-ups, and conferences relevant to the DeSci community. This feature ensures users never miss out on significant happenings in the realm of decentralized science.
3. **World of DeSci Map**: An interactive map showcasing global DeSci initiatives, collaborations, and hubs. This visual representation connects researchers based on geographic or thematic areas of interest.
4. **Open Research NFT Listings**: A marketplace for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) related to research findings, articles, and innovations. This allows for the monetization and recognition of unique research contributions in the DeSci space.
5. **Q\&A Forum (Educational Space?)**: A collaborative space where users can post questions, answer queries, and engage in in-depth discussions. It acts as an educational hub for those looking to dive deeper into specific topics within DeSci.
6. **Jobs Board**: A listing of job opportunities within the DeSci ecosystem, catering to various skill sets and expertise levels.
7. **Newsletter**: A periodic update (if implemented) that curates the latest news, developments, and opportunities within the DeSci community, ensuring users stay informed.

### Enabling the DeScientist to engage the ecosystem**&#x20;

In essence, the DS Terminal acts as the nerve center for the global DeSci community, bridging the gap between research, collaboration, and technology. The terminal enables the open source nature of decentralized science by considering the research community as key users of the platform, providing tooling to let the DeScienists flourish. We believe this paves the way for a more integrated and holistic research paradigm.
