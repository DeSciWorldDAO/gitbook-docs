# Composable Knowledge

## Compasability

Composability is akin to building with LEGO bricks. Web3 is known for building an interoperable stack: components with a specific usecase that can be combined with others to create entirely new products. This concept is what drives the standardisation of EVM infrastructures.

In the PoK system we have two types of composabilty:

1. **Compasable Knowledge Units**: The kEngram unit itself can be considered as a part of the "DeSci stack"; designed so that it can be incorporated with other DeSci projects as a data input.
2. **Composable Knowledge**: Each piece of knowledge, or more precisely, each [attestation](composable-knowledge.md#attestations), can stand alone but, when combined, they form a more complex and intricate structure to the benefit of the research.&#x20;

#### AI Services

As the kEngram continues to be used among a global network of AI interfaces, each interaction and usage is also documented. These records contribute to an kEngram's ongoing validation in our ecosystem. This evidence-based approach ensures that each kEngram's relevance, accuracy, and utility are continuously verified, evaluated, and updated.&#x20;
