# Brains

### What is a Brain?

A "Brain" is the name we give to a [decentralised knowledge graph (DKG)](../further-reading/dkg.md), indexed by PoK. There are n-number Brains, each defined by the specific [kEngram](kengram.md) index that is queried by the RAG LLM search system. A Brain can be considered a coordination tool, optimised for decentralised collaboration and knowledge management, especially useful for DAOs. Brains may communicate with other Brains in an automated manner using PoK.

A Brain consists of the data provided by its constituents; it is only as useful as the data contained within. Well structured, thoughtfully written and plentifully supplied kEngrams fuel a competent Brain. A properly maintained Brain is an incredibly powerful tool for task management; knowledge sharing; internal auditing and more. Each Brain can be queried LLM-style, to stay abreast of work updates, to specifically question internal activites and potentially create new workflow pathways.

Brains require care and attention to function best, namely:

* Well structured and consistent data types - the kEngram
* Coherent[^1][ ](coherence.md)internal data structures
* Regular contribution to the knowledge base

### Motivation for Brains

The future is decentralised. As we transition into a new world, we must reimagine:

* people and their relationships;&#x20;
* data (knowledge) and its value;&#x20;
* technology and its impact&#x20;

Brains perform a trustless and continuous service for communities, by embedding and relaying their information for them. The kE system that forms a Brain's graph creates an unbreakable link to the data (knowledge) provided, allowing provenance and thus more fair value distribution for any value generated. The unopinionated and permissionless nature of Brains put powerful technology in the hands of individuals, provide them ownership over that technology and derive value for the contributors. This is a reimagining of the role of the individual in the AI-driven future, that places the human at the centre of the digital age.

Further, the data that is consumed by AI can be framed as "knowledge for its brain". As we begin to consume knowledge is novel ways such as AI, VR and BMI interfaces, how can we ensure that we maintain the links to the real world and the people that produce that knowledge? These questions must be brought into the forefront and we see that Brains are the first open source and distributed answer to this question - collaborative and attested knowledge creation designed for machine readability.

### _Yggdrasil_

_Yggdrasil_ is the **globally coherent brain state** informed by the sum total of all kEngrams published to the public PoK pipelines. Our intention is offer permissionless access to a thriving and peer-reviewed vector database of knowledge, as a public good, through free use of Yggdrasil.
