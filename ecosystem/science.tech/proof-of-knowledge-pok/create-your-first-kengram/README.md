# Create your first kEngram

### Chapter 1: Expanded Introduction to Engrams

**What is an Engram?**

An Engram is a unit of cognitive information within the human brain, theorized to be the means by which memories are stored and recalled. In the context of a Knowledge Graph, an Engram is a structured unit of knowledge, consisting of a research question and the related research data.

**Purpose of an Engram**

Engrams provide a systematic way to structure data and knowledge. These are not just a digital representation of an idea or a concept, but are dynamic learning steps that can evolve by learning from user interactions and feedback.

Engrams can be beneficial in various areas such as:

* **Scientific Research**: Engrams can act as tools for structuring and relating the complex and vast data involved in scientific research. They can advance the processes of analyzing, understanding and conceptualizing scientific phenomena.
* **Education**: Engrams can provide an interactive learning experience. By exploiting the interconnected structure of Knowledge Graphs, learning becomes a process of exploration rather than rote memorization.
* **Machine Learning**: Engrams can serve as building blocks for Machine Learning models. These units of information, paired with their relational structure, can teach a model to understand, learn, and predict better.

**Structure of an Engram**

An Engram is organized into several integral sections:

1. **Research Question:** At the core of every Engram is a research question. This question sets the scope of the Engram and decides the nature and domain of data it will comprise.
2. **Research Data:** Once the research question is framed clearly, the next step is to compile the data that would provide an answer to the query. This data can be drawn from a vast variety of sources depending on the question it seeks to answer.
3. **Metadata:** This is essential for maintaining the systematics and security of Engrams. The metadata of an Engram would contain details regarding its creator, creation date, time, location of storage, access protocols among other things.
4. **Unique Identifier:** Each Engram within a system is assigned a Unique Identifier. This is necessary to avoid ambiguity and confusion in commanding, addressing and managing each Engram.
5. **Relationships:** This involves linking your Engram to other related Engrams to form the Knowledge Graph. This relational structuring helps in organizing data, understanding context, and enabling meaningful navigation through the knowledge network.

**The Process of Engram Creation**

Creating an Engram revolves around developing a research question, gathering related data, formatting and structuring this data, and then defining its relationships. Depending on the complexity of the research question, this process can be straightforward or involve a significant level of exploration, compilation, and arrangement of data.

Next, we'll delve into the installation process and setting up your system to start creating your very Engram.

In the next chapter, we'll look into the step-by-step process of how to install all the necessary tools and plugins to begin creating your first Engram. Let's get into it!

### Chapter 2:&#x20;

#### Chapter 3: Detailed Guide to Creating Your First Engram

Creating an engram involves careful planning, robust research, and precise execution. Here's an in-depth walkthrough to guide you through the process:

**3.1 Launching Obsidian and Creating a New Note**

To start creating an Engram:

1. Double click on the Obsidian icon on your desktop or launch it from your programming menu.
2. Once you've opened Obsidian, locate and click the "New Note" button on the left sidebar. A new note window opens on the right.

**3.2 Defining the Research Question**

The research question is what you wish to answer with this engram. Spend some time to phrase the question appropriately. Remember:

1. Questions should be open-ended (avoid yes/no answers).
2. It should steer towards requiring in-depth research.
3. It should have a clear objective, aiming towards a goal.
4. Formatting is Important: Use the Heading 1 format for your research question to differentiate it from the rest of your text.

Once you've determined your research question, type it out in the note.

**3.3 Curating Research Data**

Now, it's time to gather supporting information that helps answer your research question:

1. Use the split-screen feature in Obsidian to browse the internet and structure your research without having to switch windows.
2. As you find relevant resources, copy and paste it into your original note.
3. Make use of the bullet-point or numbering systems in Obsidian for organizing your research in a structured manner.

**3.4 Tagging Your Note**

Once the note is populated with your research concerning the question, it's time to tag your note:

1. Tags help organize notes on certain topics under their respective hashtags for easy retrieval and reference.
2. To add a tag, click anywhere on your note and type the "#" symbol, followed by your tag word.
3. For instance, if your research question pertains to AI development, your tag might be "#AIdevelopment".

**3.5 Creating Relationships**

Now that you have your research question, research data, and tags, it's time to weave it together by creating relationships:

1. Do this by linking relevant engrams or notes to your new engram.
2. In Obsidian, you can create links by typing "\[\[" followed by the name of the note you wish to link.
3. Creating linkages allows for exploration of different research pathways from a single Research Question, adding a unique dimension to your engram.

Relationships can also be created via the "canvas" visual interface via the "Link Exploder" plugin

1. Press `CTRL+P` or `Command+P` for Mac users to access the plugin window
2. Type "Link Exploder" in the search bar and select

This will generate a visual canvas where you note will be displayed as a box. New notes can be added by left-clicking the canvas and selecting "Add Card". Notes can be linked together via arrows by hovering the pointer over one of the four sides of the card and dragging the arrow to the desired liked note.

It should be noted that the direction of the arrow informs the context and coherence of the relations across the different notes.

**3.6 Saving and Reviewing Your Engram**

After you've completed these steps:

1. Press `CTRL+S` or `Command+S` for Mac users to save your work.
2. Review your note and make any necessary adjustments.
3. Try navigating the links you've created and evaluating whether your engram seems complete.

That's it! You've created your very first engram! With practice and a deeper understanding of how engrams behave, you'll be on your way to creating more complex and detailed engrams. Remember, the goal of an engram is not simply to compile information but to build a meaningful and structured knowledge base around a question.

#### Chapter 4: Understanding kNeuron Profile

The kNeuron profile is an integral aspect of the engram creation and management process. It provides structure and purpose for your engram.

**4.1 What is a kNeuron Profile?**

The kNeuron profile is essentially a blueprint for the functionality and features of your engram. It defines the role and responsibilities of your engram within the knowledge graph system, as well as the expected outputs or objectives of the engram's execution.

**4.2 Elements of a kNeuron Profile**

The kNeuron profile comprises several elements. Each of these elements plays an integral role in shaping the functional contours of your engram.

1. **Task:** This defines the core function or goal to be accomplished by the engram.
2. **Responsibilities:** These are the specific actions or processes the engram needs to take or oversee to accomplish the task.
3. **Contextual Parameters:** These are variables that influence, or are influenced by, the performance or output of the tasks.
4. **Outputs:** These elements identify what qualifies as successful execution of a task or responsibility.
5. **Meta-Parameters:** These features provide additional input to other engrams at a subsequent stage, influencing the output of the kEngram.

**4.3 Applying the kNeuron Profile**

To understand and apply a kNeuron profile correctly, consider the following steps:

1. **Define your Goal:** Identify what you want your engram to achieve. This could be anything from generating a report, guiding a process, providing information, or making a decision.
2. **Identify Tasks and Responsibilities:** Determine the specific actions or steps your engram must take to achieve the defined goal.
3. **Designate Contextual Parameters:** Identify factors that can shape or influence the execution of your engram's tasks or responsibilities.
4. **Determine Outputs:** Specify what constitutes a successful performance of the assigned tasks and responsibilities. The outcome should align with the defined goal.
5. **Consider Meta-Parameters:** Anticipate possible future interactions with other engrams, and outline the contributions of your engram to those interactions.

**4.4 Example of a kNeuron Profile Implementation**

Consider the example of a Document Builder kNeuron:

Understanding and applying the kNeuron profile effectively will transform the creation, structuring, execution, and utility of your engram. It's crucial in producing efficient and value-generative engrams in the evolving document space.

#### Chapter 5: Expanding on Smart Connections

Smart Connections within the realm of Engrams refer to the valuable linking process that constructs the relationships between the various data points or nodes of knowledge within an Engram. Through these connections, a multitude of Engrams and their data can form a globally coherent network of information, enhancing the utility and context of each Engram within the grand scheme of knowledge.

**Smart Connections Basics**

At the very core, smart connections are created using the linking feature in Obsidian. This is done by referencing another existing note or Engram within your currently active note or Engram.

For instance, if you have an Engram A and you're creating another Engram B where you borrow or refer to some knowledge from A, you can create a smart connection between A and B by referencing A within B. This process structures the knowledge and maintains the coherence and connectivity of the Engrams.

**Procedure to Create Smart Connections**

In order to establish Smart Connections, follow these steps:

1. Open Engram B where Engram A is to be linked.
2. At the appropriate junction, type \[\[ and start typing the name of Engram A. As you type, you will see suggestions popping up. Select Engram A from these suggestions.
3. You'll see that Engram A is now linked in Engram B. This link forms a Smart Connection.

**Types of Smart Connections**

There can be different types of smart connections based on the context, bidirectionality, and strength:

1. **Contextual Connections:** When one Engram references another because they share a contextual relationship. For example, an Engram about "Python Programming" might connect to an Engram about "Object-Oriented Programming."
2. **Bidirectional Connections:** When the connection between two Engrams exists both ways. That is, Engram A references B, and B also references A.
3. **Strength of Connections:** This is based on the number of direct connections between two Engrams. Higher the number of connections, stronger the link between the two Engrams.

**Significance of Smart Connections**

Smart connections drive a multitude of functionalities within the Engram ecosystem:

1. **Enhances Context**: Connections make the knowledge graph robust and filled with context. Observations are not isolated but interlinked with one another, enhancing understanding and recall.
2. **Facilitates Exploration**: With every related Engram just a click away, smart connections facilitate seamless exploration of related concepts, fostering a richer learning experience.
3. **Improves Serendipity**: By adhering to the principles of 'associative jumping', smart connections can lead to serendipitous discovery of knowledge, ideas, and insights.
4. **Builds Knowledge Networks**: Every Engram is a node and the connections are the relationships. Over time, these interconnected Engrams build a Knowledge Network where any concept can be understood in the context of everything it is linked to.

By fully understanding the system's ability to generate and leverage Smart Connections, you can create rich, interlinked systems of knowledge that mimic the human brain's interconnected networks. It leads to a fluid flow of information, valuable insights, and encourages holistic learning.
