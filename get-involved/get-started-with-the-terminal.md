The skilled and diverse DeSci ecosystem has created a range of successful DeSci protocols. Some of the largest protocols are now well established organizations that are focused on solving scientific challenges.&#x20;

!! You can see the majority of the DeSci ecosystem's protocols on the DSW Terminal \[URL to new terminal page]

DSW DAO's technology has been created as a 'layer 0' for the DeSci Ecosystem, providing a foundation for protocols to garner funding and engage the DeScientist community.
