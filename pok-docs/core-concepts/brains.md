# Brains

### What is a Brain?

A "Brain" is the name we give to a decentralised knowledge graph (DKG), indexed by Pok. There are n-number Brains, each defined by the specfic kEngram index that they utilise for the RAG LLM search system. A Brain can be considered a coordination tool, optimised for decentralised collaboration and knowledge management, especially useful for DAOs.

A Brain consists of the data provided by its constituents; it is only as useful as the data contained within. Well structured, thoughtfully written and plentifully supplied kEngrams fuel a competent Brain. A properly maintained Brain is an incredibly powerful tool for task management; knowledge sharing; internal auditing and more. Each Brain can be queried LLM-style, to stay abreast of work updates, to specifically question internal activites and potentially create new workflow pathways.

Brains require care and attention to function best, namely:

* Well structured and consistent data types ([kEngram](broken-reference))
* [Coherent](broken-reference) internal data structures, and global coherence to the purpose of the Brain
* Regular contribution to the knowledge base

### _Yggdrasil_

_Yggdrasil_ is the **globally coherent brain state** informed by the sum total of all kEngrams published to the public Pok pipelines. Our intention is offer permissionless access to a thriving and peer-reviewed vector database of knowledge, as a public good, through free use of Yggdrasil.

### Motivation for Brains

Given the continued growth of decentralised knowledge creation, how to access interesting or novel information is an increasing concern.

A Brain can be queried through LLMs interfacing with our API. Each query response that references data from an kEngram is tracked and hyperlinked in the response. This presents a fundamental improvement over traditional LLM chatbots as users are unable to view the underlying context for that given prompt.

The more an kEngram is recognized as beneficial or pivotal to ongoing research or learning, the more value it gains in the system, and the greater rewards are distributed to the Author who contributed it.

The Proof of Knowledge (Pok) protocol is built around the [attestation](https://docs.attest.sh/docs/core--concepts/attestations) of kEngrams (kE). kEngrams are designed as a blockchain-based primitive aimed to incentivize and reward knowledge contributions within a _decentralized architecture._&#x20;

They serve as the core building block of a globally coherent knowledge graph which can be the primary means of value creation of a[ knowledge-based economy](broken-reference), paving the way for fair recognition and incentivization of intellectual contributions, while maintaining transparency and accessibility.
