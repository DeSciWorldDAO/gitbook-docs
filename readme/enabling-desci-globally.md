3. **Education and Engagement**: Providing a comprehensive program consisting of presentations, workshops, panels, debates, and pitching sessions to educate and engage participants.

5. **Event Activities**: Hosting an inclusive array of activities, from intellectual debates to an after-party, aimed at fostering a robust networking and learning environment.
6. **Continuous Growth**: Laying down a framework for the ongoing expansion and scaling of the DeSci community, leveraging the learnings and outcomes from this event.
