# DAO Structure

DSW DAO organisational structure pulls inspiration from Haier's [RenDanHeYi](https://chozan.co/blog/digital-transformation-lessons-haiers-rendanheyi/) ([人单合一](https://www.haier.com/rdhy/2021/news/20210922\_171236.shtml)) model and Vitalik Buterin's [Convex and Concave](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2022/09/20/daos.html) decision making model, to create a structure that simultaneously promotes flexibility, efficiency and decentralisation.

View information about the 4 core units of the DSW DAO:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Microbes Governors" %}
Microbes NFT stakers are credited voting rights, as Governors.

Governors may vote on proposals submitted from only three sources:

1. the CORE team&#x20;
2. the Dispute Court&#x20;
3. or from other Microbes Governors

The Governors are the most decentralised portion of the DSW DAO, and are the most powerful overseers of governance. The Governors will vote on key decisions such as CORE Team elections, large treasury unlocks, major strategy proposals and Executive or CORE Disputes.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="CORE Pod" %}
CORE Pod members are elected on a biannual basis by the Governors.

CORE is responsible for the major strategic decisions of DeSciWorld. It will determine the overarching objectives of the Executive and Product Pods - as such, members must have extensive experience within this ecosystem.&#x20;

CORE will:&#x20;

* elect Executive Pod Leaders
* vote on budget proposals for Executive Pods
* maintain an effective internal communications framework
* handle internal disputes between Executive and Product Pods
* establish strong industry connections
* be a powerful spokesperson for DeSciWorld
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Executive Pods" %}
Executive Pods have domain-specific responsibilites and will house the bulk of the DSW DAO contributors.&#x20;

They are largely autonomous, and choose targets, their management structure and their service users. Pods will regularly communicate with the other Executive Pods and CORE to synchronise and synergise.

Exective Pod Leads (elected by CORE) will organise their team and propose a monthly operating budget to CORE. They set their own KPIs and targets as a part of the budget proposal.

The core function of the Executive Pod is to provide an expert service to other Pods within the DSW DAO. They may also contract with outside organisations if there is spare capacity that the DSW DAO Pods do not need to fill.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Example**: _Design & Marketing Executive Pod_

The desci.world Product Pod is planning a new campaign for the launch of v2 UX.

Rather than creating marketing materials themselves, or outsourcing, they can "contract" the services of the Design & Marketing Pod, who have resources and expertise that cover the entire DeSciWorld ecosystem.

This enables the Product Lead to focus solely on their product, keep the team small and lean, and have instant access to a very high quality design team.
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Product Pods" %}
Product Pods are the smallest sub-units within DSW DAO.

The Product Pod's responsibilities are:

* create a strong product & brand identity
* develop a specific communications strategy
* conduct extensive market and user research
* gather continuous feedback and propose improvements

Each Product Pod will contract the services of the Executive Pods for its materials and resources, facilitated by the Product Lead. Leads are elected by CORE, and will manage their own product team and their own targets. The Product team is given a fixed budget but may propose more when needed. Hiring for the Product Pod should occur internally, with Executive Pod members been "loaned out" to Product Pods for a temporary period.
