# How-to guide of DSW Market (Funders)
## 1. Understanding the P2P Funding Marketplace

DeSciWorld's P2P Funding Marketplace represents a modern approach for funders to directly contribute to innovative research projects across the globe. Through intuitive on-chain operations, our platform ensures a streamlined and safe funding process with complete transparency, giving you confidence in your investment decisions.

## 2. Setting Up Your Funder Profile
(Note that while funders can do so pseudonymously, building a profile will help build your reputation in the DSW ecosystem)

To get started:

i. Find the 'Create Profile' button on the P2P Funding Marketplace page. (Existing DSW profiles will be pulled to populate this section when the assigned wallet address is provided)

ii. Fill in your information – name, contact details, and interests in funding specific research areas.

iii. Indicate your funding capabilities, including the range of funding you're comfortable providing.

iv. Click 'Submit' to complete. 

Your profile allows researchers to understand more about you, making it easier to connect with relevant research projects.

## 3. Finding Promising Research Objectives

DeSciWorld's P2P Funding Marketplace hosts a variety of research projects waiting for funding:

i. Explore the platform and use built-in filters to narrow down projects that align with your interests.

ii. Click on individual projects to read in-depth about the researchers, their objectives, methods, and potential impact.

Spend time analyzing proposals to identify those that resonate with your funding goals.

## 4. Funding Proposals

If a proposal catches your eye:

i. Thoroughly review the details - make sure you're comfortable with the project requirements, costs, and timelines.

ii. To fund a project, click on 'Fund this Proposal'. 

iii. Specify the amount you wish to fund and be confident that this money will be held securely in escrow until project milestones are reached.

## 5. Escrow and On-chain transactions

Our platform uses blockchain and smart contract technology to ensure secure transactions and transparency. When you fund a project, your money is held in escrow - it is released the researcher when project milestones are met. All transactions are recorded on the blockchain and can be viewed for full transparency.

## 6. Monitoring Funded Proposals

Post-funding, you can monitor project progress:

i. Check the 'My Funded Projects' section in your profile to view status updates from researchers.

ii. Use our communication tools to directly engage with researchers and seek clarification or further updates.

## 7. Engaging with Researchers

Keeping open lines of communication with researchers you fund enhances mutual understanding and trust. Use the communication tools on our platform to maintain contact and stay updated on the progress of your funded projects.

## 8. Understanding Fees

A transaction fee, ranging from 1-5%, is charged on the total value of funding transacted. As a funder, you should take into account these fees when agreeing on the fund amount with the researcher.

## 9. Support and Resources

If you run into any issues or have queries, our dedicated support team is ready to assist. Visit the 'Contact Us' section on the platform. You can also check out our FAQs and other resources to better navigate the platform. At DeSciWorld's P2P Funding Marketplace, we're committed to making your journey as a funder rewarding and impactful.
