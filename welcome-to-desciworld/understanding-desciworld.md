# Understanding DeSciWorld

DeSci is a quickly evolving sector that is demonstrating how blockchain can transform open research. DeSciWorld is a uniquely positioned organization that believes with the right infrastructure DeSci can revolutionize research. To understand DeSciWorld you need to consider four key areas:

1. What is open research and why does DeSci exist?
2. On-chain science
3. Deep dive on DeSci World
4. Empowering the DeScientist

Should you be looking to engage or just understand DeSciWorld, we strongly recommend taking the time to digest the following information.&#x20;

**1: What is open research and why does DeSci exist?**

At present, early-stage research is a sorely under-utilised resource. \[Add something re Open Research].

> “Decentralized science (DeSci) is a movement that aims to build public infrastructure for funding, creating, reviewing, crediting, storing, and disseminating scientific knowledge fairly and equitably using the Web3 stack.”

Decentralising the fundamental processes in the field of science can unlock the potential of the world's minds. It is possible to imagine a world in which science occurs anywhere that there is ability and interest. Removed from narratives, vested interests and restrictive cultural practises, science can return to its foundational principles through leveraging DLT technology within blockchains.&#x20;

**2: On-chain science: Decentralized science**

DeSci, an abbreviation for "Decentralized Science," represents an innovative approach to the realm of scientific research and dissemination. By leveraging decentralized methodologies, DeSci seeks to challenge traditional centralized research structures, fostering a more inclusive and collaborative ecosystem.

This model not only ensures the democratization of knowledge but also reinforces the principles of transparency, reproducibility, and accessibility in scientific endeavors. As a progressive movement within the academic landscape, DeSci underscores the importance of returning scientific authority to a global collective, mitigating biases and potential censorships typically encountered in more conventional frameworks.

**3: Deep dive on DeSci World**

Through DeSciWorld we envisage a platform for scientists to explore funding for Decentralized Research.

* DeSciWorld has a suite of products focused on facilitating the Decentralized Science community, placing the DAO at the centre of the ecosystem
* We seek to facilitate a global level, creating a level playing field for developing nations
* There is no way DeSci will work in the long run if we do not integrate effectively and positive with traditional research or academia

#### A multifaceted platform to drive DeSci

Our mission is clear: to strengthen and connect the decentralized research community while offering unwavering support to innovators everywhere. We believe in making science accessible to everyone, ensuring it remains unbiased, uncensored, and resistant to external pressures.

**4: Empowering the DeScientist: Science.tech**

Created by DeSciWorld DAO [Science.Tech](http://science.tech) is the manifestion of our mission to unlock the potential of open research by providing the platform and tools to realize its potential. It is crucial to understand that DSW DAO will continue to develop and support the DeSciWorld ecosystem through both community and the creation of products.&#x20;

#### What is Science.Tech?

Science.Tech is a cutting-edge platform designed to revolutionize the research landscape by empowering open researchers with a secure environment for deploying and funding research initiatives. This platform leverages blockchain technology to enhance trust, transparency, and the overall efficiency of research collaborations and funding mechanisms.

Through Science.Tech we provide:

1. UI for Open Researchers
2. Smart Contract Escrow for P2P Interactions
3. On-chain Attestations
4. Profile Building for Research Teams
5. Central Point for Research
6. Modular Structure: DeSci Ecosystem Integration
