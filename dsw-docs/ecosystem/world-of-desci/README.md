# World of DeSci

## Mission

World of DeSci provides a trusted, in-person platform for DeSci ecosystem participants to build their network, engage with investors, find career opportunites and grow their profile.&#x20;

These events see industry leaders such as founders, project stakeholders and thought leaders gather to deliver talks, host workshops and engage the scientific community.&#x20;

Aligned to our mission of fostering a strong community, the World of DeSci aims to foster a self-sustaining DeSci ecosystem that continues to grow and operate independently beyond the duration of the event.&#x20;

***

The initiative is dedicated to achieving the following objectives:

1. **Community Building**: Cultivating a community within a specific geographical location that can serve as a model for future DeSci communities globally.
2. **Integration Efforts**: Ensuring integration across multiple local sectors, including industry, academia, web3 ecosystems, and government councils.
3. **Education and Engagement**: Providing a comprehensive program consisting of presentations, workshops, panels, debates, and pitching sessions to educate and engage participants.
4. **Promotion and Outreach**: Conducting extensive social media campaigns prior to and following the event to maximize visibility and impact for the attendees and our partners.
5. **Event Activities**: Hosting an inclusive array of activities, from intellectual debates to an after-party, aimed at fostering a robust networking and learning environment.
6. **Continuous Growth**: Laying down a framework for the ongoing expansion and scaling of the DeSci community, leveraging the learnings and outcomes from this event.

## **Why does DeSci need to be global?**

We seek to facilitate a global equilibrium in the distribution and participation of DeSci's technology, creating a level playing field for developing nations that have historically not had engagement of&#x20;

The Western scientific establishment is well defined and has immense power of capital and intellectual capture. The perspectives garnered from researchers and innovators globally will go a long way to correcting some of the concerns we have today. Understanding the depths of this universe and our place within it requires to sacral knowledge from every corner of the globe.&#x20;

Further, different nations have different regulatory and political environments and science may be more efficient or easier to conduct in different countries. Some government ministries may be more willing to embrace DeSci when the upside potential is so large. DeSci will not work in the long run if we do not integrate effectively and positively with traditional research and academia.

We host real-world events around the world, with a keen focus on countries and communities outside of Western Europe and North America.
