# Validation & Value Attribution

## Incentive Framework

The Ethereum Attestation Service lays the groundwork for our incentive mechanism. Each attestation becomes part of the computation determining value attribution and reward distribution.

> EAS ensures a transparent and fair system where contributors of Engrams are rewarded based on actual utility and demand in the ecosystem. You can see more about this here: [https://attest.sh/](https://attest.sh/)

The use of EAS within the PoK protocol forms a trustworthy and secure system for validating knowledge contributions and rewarding contributors. It answers the call for a distributed, transparent, and reliable method to authenticate, validate, and incentivize meaningful engagements in a decentralized knowledge ecosystem.

## "Validation" of Knowledge

The validation process within the DeSciWorld PoK ecosystem operates as an emergent property of a free market of knowledge. It is an unconstrained arena where diverse viewpoints vie for relevancy, encouraging a robust, dynamic interplay of ideas and perspectives.

Unlike conventional, centralized validation systems, _this decentralized model_ does not pre-emptively adjudicate or prioritize one piece of knowledge over another. Instead, the relevancy of each kEngram or Study Question (SQ) is determined organically through its usage and demand within the ecosystem.

In this free market of knowledge, each kEngram competes for attention and usage. The merit of an Engram is not determined by a unilateral authority but through its actual utility and effectiveness in satisfying a user's query or task. Engrams that demonstrate persistent usefulness and applicability over time, as judged through the unbiased lens of Language Learning Models (LLMs), accrue higher relevancy scores.

This competitive and responsive environment ensures that the validation process is continuously refined and realigned according to the evolving needs and preferences of users. It overcomes inherent biases and silos, fostering a system where the best, most useful, and most relevant knowledge prospers.

In essence, within the DeSciWorld model, validation isn't a one-time stamp of approval but a continuous process of adaptation, adjustment, and evolution â€” a dynamic reflection of a knowledge unit's continuous performance in the marketplace of ideas and information.
