# Understanding DeSciWorld

## What is DeSciWorld?&#x20;

DeSciWorld is an organisation; an ecosystem. It consists of technical products, a decentralised economic system, a diverse and global community and a cultural force for change.&#x20;

Guided by the mission to unite and empower the decentralized research community, DeSciWorldâ€™s commitment is to faciliate a scientific renaissance in an authentic, transparent, and resilient manner. The platform offers a comprehensive suite of tools geared towards fostering community engagement, enhancing global participation, and championing the ethos of open science.

## Evolution of the ecosystem



Started in September 2021, DeSciWorld began as an idea to bring research funding onchain through Peer-to-Peer (P2P) infrastructure. Originally named "DeSciDAO", it incorporated many of the ideas learned by founder Joshua during his time working in DeFi. The core product design was to connect researchers and funders permissionlessly, even anonymously, to facilitate science that might disagree with official narratives during the COVID pandemic. However, it soon became clear that:

&#x20;   a) the DeSci ecosystem was not large or influential enough to facilitate meaningful capital inflows for research,

&#x20;   b) the nascient DeSci ecosystem was actually quite deep, yet was not doing a good job of advertising itself to the rest of the crypto ecosystem (we had never heard of "DeSci" until a few weeks after launching this protocol).

As such, DeSciDAO pivoted to become DeSciWorld.&#x20;

The objective shifted from creating a P2P funding platform to something much larger and more ambitious in scope; to become the global hub of DeSci, to use our platform to improve participation in this ecosystem, to provide outreach and web3 mechanism design assistance to other projects and generally to become a cultural vehicle for change within academia.
