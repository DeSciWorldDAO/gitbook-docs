### Proof of Knowledge

cutting-edge platform designed to revolutionize the research landscape by empowering open researchers with a secure environment for deploying and funding research initiatives. We believe knowledge is power and science.tech's mission is to:&#x20;

1. Optimize the experience for open researchers.
2. Enable research teams to access funding opportunities
3. Provide secure processes for peer-to-peer (P2P) funding
4. Facilitate decentralized science through on-chain attestations and knowledge creation.
5. Establish an industry-standard central hub for research IP (intellectual property) management.
6. Ensure adaptability for use in a modular structure across the decentralized science (DeSci) ecosystem.

Through this section you will learn more about science.tech and get started as an open researcher.&#x20;
