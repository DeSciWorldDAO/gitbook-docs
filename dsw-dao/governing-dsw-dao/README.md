# Microbes NFT

## **The Collection**

**Microbes** is our debut NFT collection. Together with friends from [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/232035/boosted-economy-decentralised-science-news-from/), images of real PhD microbiology research were gathered and artistically rendered to create this collection.

### Traits and Rarity <a href="#b461" id="b461"></a>

‚ÄúMicrobes‚Äù contains 999 heterogenous pieces of art in three core categories:

* 444 üß´ Bacteria
* 333 üçÑ Funghi
* 222 ü¶† Virus

Alongside these three principle categories, there are also a number of traits that provide additional rarity distinctions for your NFT, such as:

* Biosafety Level (i.e. BSL1, BSL4)
* Movement (i.e. spin, burst)
* Assembly (i.e. particle, protein)
* Magnification (i.e. atomic, 63x)

These characteristics help to define each piece within the collection whilst also giving the viewer a deeper understanding of what analysis researchers use when interacting with their data.

### Unlockable Content <a href="#30b2" id="30b2"></a>

181 of the 999 Microbes NFTs contain some form of unlockable content. The unlockable content ranges from source imaging (pre-manipulation), reports and even raw imagery data such as this:

## Holders and Benefits

We consider holding a Microbes a signal of our most dedicated community members. Thus, the Microbes NFT bestows upon its holders the following privileges:

<details>

<summary>Governance Rights <mark style="color:green;">- when staked</mark></summary>

Microbes NFT can be locked for various periods of time to receive voting rights in the DSW DAO.&#x20;

The Microbes NFT is a suitable token to assign the DSW DAO's decentralised governance protocol. The NFT was created with no capital backing, by the founding members of DeSciWorld, distributed organically over more than a two-year period.&#x20;

A small supply of 999 enables sufficient decentralisation while maintaining an efficient roster of participants that can be organised and incentivised. The core goal is engaged, proactive and informed governance from a decentralised community.&#x20;

</details>

<details>

<summary>Governor Stream <mark style="color:green;">- when staked</mark></summary>

Microbes Governors (those that have locked their NFT in the Governor contract) are entitled to a stream of emissions from the Emissions Schedule. This is designed to motivate holders to participate in effective governance.&#x20;

</details>

<details>

<summary>Redistributive Lottery</summary>

DeSciWorld intends to accumulate digital assets from the DeSci and greater Web3 ecosystem for periodical redistribution to Microbes holders via lottery-style raffles.

The Lottery is only accessible for Microbes NFT holders at the time of each round's "Cut-off Block". Once the draw has been announced, the NFT holders will need to claim their potential prize through our interface. It is a method for us to continuously reward our most loyal community members.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Preferential Access</summary>

As our ecosystem grows, we will have a number of special events that require "VIP access lists"; we will regularly reward Microbes holders with preferential access.

## Background

{% hint style="info" %}
The Microbes NFT was created by a private entity, outside of the DeSciWorld DAO. Thus, the DAO has no control over the proceeds of the sale. Ostensibly, the funds are used to assist in the initial bootstrapping phase of the DAO‚Äôs existence. Further, Microbes has a 5% royalty fee on all sales.
{% endhint %}

The Microbes NFT [contracts](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x61c300639534a3cba4c73b515f185ef54ac32e2a74fe509f6317833bd4fc1227) were deployed November 15th 2021 with the intention of funding development for the project that became DeSciWorld. Created outside of the DeSciWorld DAO‚Äôs jurisdiction, Microbes sales have been used by DeSciWorld to fund operations in the bootstrapping phase of the protocol's growth.&#x20;

DeSciWorld posted a [Medium article](https://medium.com/desciworld/launch-day-microbes-nft-a9ecc0d1d61e) explaining the Microbes NFT and its potential future use cases in 2021. Some of these stated potentialities are no longer relevant.&#x20;
