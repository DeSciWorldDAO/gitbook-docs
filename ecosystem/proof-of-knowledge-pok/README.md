### The Proof of Knowledge Protocol

The Proof of Knowledge (PoK) protocol provides an on-chain container for knowledge, interoperable with the burdgeoning "DeSci stack". PoK offers a brand new method to quantify and value knowledge - the [kEngram](kengrams.md) (kE). kE are a data object that both maintains an unbreakable chain of provenance and[ tracks its usage within the knowledge market](broken-reference). Usage of kE is to be incentivised with the $KNOW token.

An integral part of PoK is the advanced AI-based search system, the Brain. The search system is used to maintain an updated embedding set which can locate specific kEngrams as per query requirements. Each substantial interaction with an kEngram sends usage data to the PoK mechanism which can be used to determine incentives.

As a fundamental building block towards a fully-fledged [knowledge-backed economy](../../introductory-info/trifecta-of-effective-integration.md), the PoK protocol offers a comprehensive framework to fuel intellectual contribution and foster an environment of continuous learning and knowledge exchange.
