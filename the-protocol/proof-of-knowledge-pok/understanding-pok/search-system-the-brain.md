An integral part of DeSciWorld's PoK mechanism is the advanced AI-based search system. The search system is used to maintain an updated embedding set which can locate specific Engrams or Study Questions. Each substantial interaction with an Engram sends usage data to the PoK mechanism which can be used to determine incentives for the creation of relevant engrams.&#x20;

User interactions can range from the frequency of appearances of an SQ in search results, the frequency of its selection from the results, the number of direct or indirect references made to it in new SQs, and assessments of how helpful the SQ was to a user's research or learning process. The system measures these interactions and, based on that, adjusts the value of each Engram.&#x20;

The more an Engram is recognized as beneficial or pivotal to ongoing research or learning, the more value it gains in the system, and the greater rewards are distributed to the Nerd who contributed it.

### Engram Evolution&#x20;

As knowledge terrains continue to expand and evolve, so do Engrams. Along the life-cycle, an Engram may undergo several evolutions, manifested as updates, revisions, or further value additions. New data may be contributed, older information may be updated or made obsolete, and new connections to different Engrams may be established. All these changes contribute to the growing lifecycle of an Engram, helping it remain relevant, useful, and accurate in the dynamic ecosystem of the Knowledge Graph.&#x20;

In essence, the life-cycle of an Engram is a continual journey of knowledge creation, addition, validation, utilization, and evolution. It encourages constant engagement, collaboration, and learning, fostering a vibrant, interconnected hub of collective knowledge.&#x20;
