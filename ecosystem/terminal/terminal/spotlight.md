# Projects

The DeSciWorld Dashboard is a free-to-use online information hub that aggregates and displays information about DeSci projects in an easily digestible format. We aim for it to become a primary resource for learning about all that DeSci has to offer. It allows researchers/academics/VCs/non-scientists to obtain information about all DeSci-relevant projects. Scientists / DeSciDAOs / other people related to DeSci can also expand outreach for their work, grow networks, access resources from a huge and growing community and even apply for funding.

Project pages display relevant information about individual DeSci projects, such as information about tokens and governance proposals, media embeds, short descriptions and relevant links. These pages allow users to get a quick overview of a project before fully diving into their community.
