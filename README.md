# Introducing DeSciWorld

**DeSciWorld**\
/di'saɪ'wɜːld/\
_noun_\
&#x20;   _1._ the global hub of decentralised science\
&#x20;   2\. an onboarding tool; a cultural vehicle\
&#x20;   3\. a technical platform

## What is DeSciWorld?

DeSciWorld is an organisation; an ecosystem. It consists of [technical products](ecosystem/science.tech/), a decentralised [economic system](broken-reference), a diverse and global community and a cultural force for change.&#x20;

Guided by the mission to unite and empower the decentralized research community, DeSciWorld’s commitment is to facilitate a scientific renaissance in an authentic, transparent, and resilient manner.&#x20;

Through the proliferation of our Proof of Knowledge (PoK) protocol, we provide an interoperable container for knowledge that is \
\
&#x20;additionally, the platform offers a comprehensive suite of tools geared towards fostering community engagement, enhancing [global participation](broken-reference), and championing the ethos of open science.



> How do we talk about DeSciWorld? (notes from workshops)&#x20;
>
> * A platform for scientists to explore funding for Decentralized Research
> * DeSciWorld has a suite of products focused on facilitating the Decentralized Science community, placing the DAO at the centre of the ecosystem
> * We seek to facilitate a global level, creating a level playing field for developing nations
> * There is no way DeSci will work in the long run if we do not integrate effectively and positive with traditional research or academia

## Why are we here?

DeSciWorld was created in September 2021, after the COVID pandemic exposed some fundamental concerns with the scientific paradigm: censorship, bias, illicit public-private partnerships, profiteering, inefficiencies, uninformed populations, uneven distribution of data and medicine, to name a few.

In a time of converging technologies, handing the right to determination of the future of humanity, the keys to the ignition of tools of destruction, the honour of shepherding the great masses of the world to _**any one entity**_ is a folly.&#x20;

We must create the tools that decentralise and distribute the power that is afforded to technology, before control of those tools is absolute.

## Our Evolutionary Timeline \[This has been included in section 3]

Started in September 2021, DeSciWorld began as an idea to bring research funding onchain through Peer-to-Peer (P2P) infrastructure. Originally named "DeSciDAO", it incorporated many of the ideas learned by founder Joshua during his time working in DeFi. The core product design was to connect researchers and funders permissionlessly, even anonymously, to facilitate science that might disagree with official narratives during the COVID pandemic. However, it soon became clear that:

&#x20;   a) the DeSci ecosystem was not large or influential enough to facilitate meaningful capital inflows for research,

&#x20;   b) the nascient DeSci ecosystem was actually quite deep, yet was not doing a good job of advertising itself to the rest of the crypto ecosystem (we had never heard of "DeSci" until a few weeks after launching this protocol).

As such, DeSciDAO pivoted to become DeSciWorld.&#x20;

The objective shifted from creating a P2P funding platform to something much larger and more ambitious in scope; to become the global hub of DeSci, to use our platform to improve participation in this ecosystem, to provide outreach and web3 mechanism design assistance to other projects and generally to become a cultural vehicle for change within academia.
