# Introducing DeSciWorld

**DeSciWorld**\
/di'saɪ'wɜːld/\
&#xNAN;_&#x6E;oun_\
&#x20;   _1._ the global hub of decentralised science\
&#x20;   2\. an onboarding tool; a cultural vehicle\
&#x20;   3\. a technical platform

## What is DeSciWorld?

DeSciWorld is an [ecosystem](ecosystem/ecosystem-map.md) consisting of:

* **desci.world** [<>](ecosystem/terminal/)
  * an information aggregator for the DeSci space since 2021
* **science.tech** [<>](ecosystem/science.tech/)
  * a suite of technical products powered by the Proof of Knowledge (PoK) protocol
* **World of DeSci** [<>](ecosystem/world-of-desci/)
  * a diverse and global community event circuit
* **$KNOW** [<>](ecosystem/usddsci-or-usdknow-token.md)
  * a decentralised economic system driven by knowledge creation and transfer
* **Microbes NFT** [<>](ecosystem/governing-dsw-dao/)
  * A limited supply <mark style="color:yellow;">golden ticket</mark> for the most dedicated DeSciWorld adopters

DeSciWorld can be considered the global hub of decentralised science. We provide a range of tools to inform and empower the (de)scientist. More than just technical, we also consider ourselves a cultural force within the space. We advocate consistently for a more humanity and nature [aligned science](introductory-info/trifecta-of-effective-integration.md) paradigm, eschewing the profit and reputation temptations that come with upholding the status quo.

## The DeSciWorld Mission

### Social

By promoting and expanding the culture of Decentralised Science, we aim to empower (de)scientists to conduct research on their own terms, without compromise, and to help them effectively capture the value generated by their work.

### Technical

Through the [Proof of Knowledge](ecosystem/science.tech/proof-of-knowledge-pok.md) protocol, we will create a knowledge-backed economy in an AI-driven future by placing user-generated-research (UGR) at the heart of our interactions with GPTs. Further, we provide a sandbox of on-chain tools at science.tech for researchers to utilise with minimal setup or experience required.

### Guiding Values

We strive to be an **agnostic** ecosystem facilitators for DeSci projects. Our ambition is to generate sustainable income for the DAO and redistribute AMAP into the hands of builders and researchers. Committed to a future with equality of opportunity and access, globally, we hope to deliver genuine moments of happiness and wonder to the DeSci ecosystem.

## Timeline

### Our History&#x20;

Originally named "DeSciDAO", DeSciWorld began as an idea to bring research funding onchain through Peer-to-Peer (P2P) infrastructure. The core product design was to connect researchers and funders permissionlessly, even anonymously, to facilitate science that might disagree with official narratives.&#x20;

However, it soon became clear that:

&#x20;   a) the DeSci ecosystem was not large or influential enough to facilitate meaningful capital inflows for research;

&#x20;   b) the nascient DeSci ecosystem was actually quite deep, yet was not doing a good job of advertising itself to the rest of the crypto ecosystem (we had never heard of "DeSci" until a few days after launching this protocol).

As such, DeSciDAO pivoted to become DeSciWorld.&#x20;

The objective shifted from creating a P2P funding platform to something much larger and more ambitious in scope: to become the global hub of DeSci, to use our platform to improve participation in this ecosystem, to provide outreach and web3 mechanism design assistance to other projects and generally to become a cultural vehicle for change within academia.

Together, these initiatives present an innovative platform to reshape the landscape of scientific research and how it is funded.&#x20;
