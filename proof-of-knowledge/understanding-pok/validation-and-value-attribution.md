# Validation & Value Attribution

## Introduction to Usage

Validation within the PoK protocol operates as an emergent property of a <mark style="color:green;">free market of knowledge</mark>. Usage metrics, combined with other continously updating feedbacks, determine the validity and value of the knowledge in a market-based model.

In essence, within the Proof of Knowledge model, validation isn't a one-time stamp of approval but a continuous process of adaptation, adjustment, and evolution â€” a dynamic reflection of a knowledge unit's continuous performance in the marketplace of ideas and information, that simultaneously helps to determine its value.

## Tracking Usage Metrics

The Ethereum Attestation Service lays the groundwork for our usage tracking mechanism.

## "Market Validation" of Knowledge

In this free market of knowledge, each kEngram competes for attention and usage. As the kEngram continues to be queried by a global network of AI interfaces, each interaction and usage is documented. These records contribute to an kEngram's ongoing validation in our ecosystem.&#x20;

Unlike conventional, centralized validation systems, _this decentralized model_ does not pre-emptively adjudicate or prioritize one piece of knowledge over another. Instead, the relevancy of each kEngram is determined organically through its usage and demand within the ecosystem.

This evidence-based approach ensures that each kEngram's relevance, coherence, and utility are continuously verified, evaluated, and updated. It overcomes inherent biases and silos, fostering a system where the best, most useful, and most relevant knowledge prospers.

## Permissionless Ratification of Knowledge

The Research Collective ecosystem facilitates groups to gather around specific types of knowledge. Each Research Collective (RC) may begin deploying kEngrams from the RC's interface. They may also aggregate the kEngrams of others, into their "accepted list", that acts as a de-facto ratification of the kEngram. When an kEngram is aggregated into the "accepted list" of an RC, that kE receives a tag in its metadata to show that its been ratified by that Collective. This allows permissionless ratification of knowledge, in a decentralised manner. The kEngrams can then be filtered by levels of ratification, including amount of ratified support and also where that ratification came from. Want to filter kEngrams by those that have been ratified by the Oxford University Research Collective, or by the University of Ethereum RC? Now you can!
