# Creating Your First kEngram

Before you begin this section you need to have Obsidian open and have opened a new note, you do this by clicking the "New Note" button on the left sidebar.&#x20;

**Defining the Research Question**

The research question is what you wish to answer with this engram. Spend some time to phrase the question appropriately. Remember:

1. Questions should be open-ended (avoid yes/no answers).
2. It should steer towards requiring in-depth research.
3. It should have a clear objective, aiming towards a goal.
4. Formatting is Important: Use the Heading 1 format for your research question to differentiate it from the rest of your text.

Once you've determined your research question, type it out in the note.

**Curating Research Data**

Now, it's time to gather supporting information that helps answer your research question:

1. Use the split-screen feature in Obsidian to browse the internet and structure your research without having to switch windows.
2. As you find relevant resources, copy and paste it into your original note.
3. Make use of the bullet-point or numbering systems in Obsidian for organizing your research in a structured manner.

**3.4 Tagging Your Note**

Once the note is populated with your research concerning the question, it's time to tag your note:

1. Tags help organize notes on certain topics under their respective hashtags for easy retrieval and reference.
2. To add a tag, click anywhere on your note and type the "#" symbol, followed by your tag word.
3. For instance, if your research question pertains to AI development, your tag might be "#AIdevelopment".

**3.5 Creating Relationships**

Now that you have your research question, research data, and tags, it's time to weave it together by creating relationships:

1. Do this by linking relevant engrams or notes to your new engram.
2. In Obsidian, you can create links by typing "\[\[" followed by the name of the note you wish to link.
3. Creating linkages allows for exploration of different research pathways from a single Research Question, adding a unique dimension to your engram.

Relationships can also be created via the "canvas" visual interface via the "Link Exploder" plugin

1. Press `CTRL+P` or `Command+P` for Mac users to access the plugin window
2. Type "Link Exploder" in the search bar and select

This will generate a visual canvas where you note will be displayed as a box. New notes can be added by left-clicking the canvas and selecting "Add Card". Notes can be linked together via arrows by hovering the pointer over one of the four sides of the card and dragging the arrow to the desired liked note.

It should be noted that the direction of the arrow informs the context and coherence of the relations across the different notes.

**3.6 Saving and Reviewing Your Engram**

After you've completed these steps:

1. Press `CTRL+S` or `Command+S` for Mac users to save your work.
2. Review your note and make any necessary adjustments.
3. Try navigating the links you've created and evaluating whether your engram seems complete.

That's it! You've created your very first engram! With practice and a deeper understanding of how engrams behave, you'll be on your way to creating more complex and detailed engrams. Remember, the goal of an engram is not simply to compile information but to build a meaningful and structured knowledge base around a question.
