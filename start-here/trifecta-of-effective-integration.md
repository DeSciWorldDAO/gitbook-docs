# Trifecta of Effective Integration

In a bid to achieve the truly distributed scientific community that Decentralised Science dreams of, we must bring the tools to the people who need them.

### Students <a href="#ea99" id="ea99"></a>

Students are the lifeblood of science. Young, passionate and often wonderfully optimistic, we believe that the most powerful and revolutionary ideas will come from this group. On the one hand students tend to have less vested interest in continuing the encumbency of the status quo â€” the system has caused many issues in the world that they must now tackle. On the other hand, students have less to lose and are more willing to take calculated risks. DeSci is primed for their adoption.

### Academia <a href="#e8d3" id="e8d3"></a>

Academic societies guide the trajectory of populations, as their research and recommendations influence policy at all levels. The DeSci community must demonstrate to these influential substrates that decentralization, along with its inherent redistributive potential, is the most effective method for addressing the pain points that science faces today. To influence policy, policymakers must be enlightened.

### Industry <a href="#id-2e3c" id="id-2e3c"></a>

The financial support provided by the industry serves as a crucial catalyst for scientific research, facilitating the exploration of groundbreaking discoveries and technological innovations. This collaboration nurtures an environment wherein researchers can translate theoretical knowledge into practical applications, directly contributing to economic growth. Through investments in science, the industry not only propels its own development but also plays a pivotal role in retaining talented minds, thereby preventing brain drain. DeSci can serve as a core toolset to empower local industry and foster cross-pollination between international industry and local research communities. This, in turn, promotes robust funding and collaborative opportunities, incentivizing scientists to remain in their home countries.
