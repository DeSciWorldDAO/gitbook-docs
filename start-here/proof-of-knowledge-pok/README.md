  Proof of Knowledge (PoK) Is a cryptographic proof that attests to the creation
  of an kEngram, which is a digital representation of a unit of knowledge.

# Proof of Knowledge (PoK)

> The Proof-of-Knowledge mechanism as part of the DeSciWorld ecosystem uses blockchain technology for incentivizing contributions and verifying the accuracy and relevance of knowledge within the network. It offers a dynamic and adaptable system that caters to the varying needs and interests of users while continually encouraging a superior standard of shared knowledge. This document outlining the process of submission and validation of knowledge through the creation of kEngrams, the ascription of value to these contributions, and how interaction metrics shape the dynamic value allocation.&#x20;

### The Proof of Knowledge Protocol

\
As a fundamental building block towards a fully-fledged knowledge-based economy, the PoK protocol offers a comprehensive framework to fuel intellectual contribution and foster an environment of continuous learning and knowledge exchange.

The Proof of Knowledge (PoK) protocol is built around the attestation of kEngrams (kE). kEngrams are designed as a blockchain-based primitive aimed to incentivize and reward knowledge contributions within a _decentralized architecture._&#x20;

They serve as the core building block of a globally coherent knowledge graph which can be the primary means of value creation of a knowledge-based economy, paving the way for fair recognition and incentivization of intellectual contributions, while maintaining transparency and accessibility.
