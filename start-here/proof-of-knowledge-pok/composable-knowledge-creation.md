  Composability is akin to building with LEGO bricks. Each piece, or in this
  case, each attestation, can stand alone, but when combined, they form a more
  complex and intricate structure. Lets dive in.

# Composable knowledge creation

### Creating&#x20;

When a kEngram is first created, it is recorded via an attestation for the research question. The creator of the kEngram is also noted through EAS, attesting that they were the original contributor of that knowledge piece. As value is added to this kEngram—be it through more data, insights, revisions, or connections—each change is also captured through an attestation, creating a trail of evolution and accumulation of intellectual input. Other users can contribute to the research by referencing their research questions to any part of the original kEngram. By chaining these units of knowledge we can create a survival of the fittest situation where knowledge units that are highly relevant will be used regularly and acquire mulitple layers of proofs for its context.&#x20;

As the kEngram continues to be used among a global network of AI interfaces, each interaction and usage is also documented. These records contribute to an Engram's ongoing validation in our ecosystem. This evidence-based approach ensures that each Engram's relevance, accuracy, and utility are continuously verified, evaluated, and updated.&#x20;

### Ethereum Attestations&#x20;

The Ethereum Attestation Service lays the groundwork for our incentive mechanism. Each attestation becomes part of the computation determining value attribution and reward distribution.&#x20;

> EAS ensures a transparent and fair system where contributors of Engrams are rewarded based on actual utility and demand in the ecosystem. You can see more about this here: [https://attest.sh/](https://attest.sh/)

The use of EAS within the PoK protocol forms a trustworthy and secure system for validating knowledge contributions and rewarding contributors. It answers the call for a distributed, transparent, and reliable method to authenticate, validate, and incentivize meaningful engagements in a decentralized knowledge ecosystem.
