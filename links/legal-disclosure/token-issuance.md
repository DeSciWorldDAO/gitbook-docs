# Token issuance

DeSciWorld will not conduct a token sale or receive any funds from investors. 100% of the total $DSCI token supply will be issued to the Uniswap market (with either $USDC, $DAI or $ETH as the base LP pair) with intentionally low initial market cap to allow early adopters to establish inexpensive exposure to $DSCI if they believe it will have a larger market in the future.

No $DSCI tokens will ever be premined or retained by the project developers. $DSCI has a predetermined finite supply and no more additional $DSCI tokens will ever be minted.

### Definitions:&#x20;

* <mark style="color:blue;">**$DSCI:**</mark> An ERC-20 token with 2 decimals; no transfer penalties. $DSCI could potentially be staked to earn shares of protocol fees and $veDSCI emissions, under proposed models. Total supply TBC.\

* <mark style="color:blue;">**$veDSCI:**</mark> A non-transferrable, non-tradable token that is used for protocol governance. If a user unstakes their $DSCI tokens, they will lose their accumulated $veDSCI. Supply is determined by the amount of $DSCI staked.\

* <mark style="color:blue;">**$preSCI:**</mark> A valueless token that represents the holderâ€™s membership to the pre-DAO and is used solely to vote on preDAO proposals.\

* <mark style="color:blue;">**$pre-veSCI:**</mark> A token identical in form and function to $veDSCI, except given immediately upon $DSCI genesis to holders of $preSCI
