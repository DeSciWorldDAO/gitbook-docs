### Pok - a Proof-of-Knowledge protocol

Pok is an advanced AI-based search system that offers a brand new method to quantify and value knowledge - the [kEngram](broken-reference) (kE). kE are an onchain data object that both maintains an unbreakable chain of provenance and tracks its usage by AI within the [knowledge market](broken-reference). Usage of kE is to be incentivised with the [$KNOW](broken-reference) token.

Pok utilises a cryptographic proof that [attests](broken-reference) to the creation of an [kEngram](broken-reference). kE are organised into indexes of knowledge called [Brains](broken-reference). The index system is used to maintain an updated embedding set which can Pok can use to locate specific kEngrams as per query requirements. Each substantial interaction with a kE sends usage data to Pok which can be used to determine incentives, in a system we coin the "[Knowledge Market](broken-reference)".

As a fundamental building block towards a fully-fledged [knowledge-backed economy](broken-reference), the Pok protocol offers a comprehensive framework to fuel intellectual contribution and foster an environment of continuous learning and knowledge exchange.
