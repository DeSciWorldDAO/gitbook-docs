## DSW P2P Funding Marketplace's Vision:

The DSW P2P Funding Marketplace envisions a world where every researcher, irrespective of their background or institutional affiliation, has fair access to the funds required to carry out their projects. It stands firmly on the belief in democratizing scientific research funding and promoting collaborative engagements between researchers and the global funding community.

The platform's primary objective is to disrupt traditional research funding mechanisms that are often bureaucratic, hinder innovation, and create barriers for independent scientists. It seeks to empower researchers to drive scientific advancements without the worry of financial constraints.

One of the key aspects of this vision is the creation of an open and dynamic scientific community. The platform looks forward to fostering a space where researchers and funders can interact freely and decide collectively on projects that address global scientific issues and further humanity's progress.
