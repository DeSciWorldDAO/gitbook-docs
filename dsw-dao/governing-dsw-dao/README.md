# Microbes NFT

**Microbes** is our debut NFT collection. Together with friends from [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/232035/boosted-economy-decentralised-science-news-from/), images of real PhD microbiology research were gathered and artistically rendered to create this collection.

The Microbes NFT [contracts](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x61c300639534a3cba4c73b515f185ef54ac32e2a74fe509f6317833bd4fc1227) were deployed November 15th 2021 with the intention of funding development for the project that became DeSciWorld.&#x20;

Created outside of the DeSciWorld DAO’s jurisdiction, Microbes sales have been used by DeSciWorld to fund operations in the bootstrapping phase of DeSciWorld’s growth. Thus, the Microbes NFT bestows upon its holders the following privileges:

<details>

<summary>Governance Rights</summary>



</details>

<details>

<summary>Retroactive Lottery</summary>



</details>

<details>

<summary>Preferential Access</summary>



</details>

* <mark style="color:blue;">**Redistribution lottery events:**</mark> DeSciWorld intends to accumulate digital assets from the DeSci and greater Web3 ecosystem for periodical redistribution to Microbes holders via lottery-style raffles.
* <mark style="color:blue;">**NFT Launchpad preferential access:**</mark> Microbe NFT holders are rewarded with privileges on our NFT Launchpad platform such as potential presale positions and gallery curator decisions.
* <mark style="color:blue;">**Unlockable content:**</mark> Certain Microbes NFTs contain unlockable content such as additional research data, reports, and even raw image files. The content is hosted on IPFS and made available through our website, secured through Web3 wallet integration. This unlockable content serves to enhance the artistic value of the Microbes NFTs.
* <mark style="color:blue;">**Experimental implementations:**</mark> Creative mechanics such as lock-ups, burns and staking may also be employed to bring the worlds of DeFi and DeSci together.
* <mark style="color:blue;">**Access to special events/areas:**</mark> VIP chat, special events at DeSci conferences, an airdrop, or merch distribution, the Microbes NFT will serve as the universal access pass.



The Microbes NFT was created by a private entity, outside of the DeSciWorld DAO. Thus, the DAO has no control over the proceeds of the sale. Ostensibly, the funds are used to assist in the initial bootstrapping phase of the DAO’s existence. Further, Microbes has a 5% royalty fee on all sales.



Ethereum wallet addresses that mint a Microbes NFT before the official launch of the DeSciWorld token ($DSCI) will be recognized within the DeSciWorld community as an “Early Adopter”.

Early Adopter roles belong to the specific wallet addresses that mint Microbes and may receive additional benefits such as preferential access to initiatives to be confirmed by the DeSciWorld DAO.
