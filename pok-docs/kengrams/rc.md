The open science movement has long advocated for distributed communities to collaborate on research, to share their knowledge more widely with other groups and to self-organise around sovereign treasuries. As the technology of DLT, tokenised assets and cheap-to-use AI has progressed, it is finally time for these structures to take effect.

Members of the Research Collectives can autonomously govern themselves via the subDAO infrastructure. They may create and amalgamate kEngrams, uniting them in a coherent repository of collective research, leverage on-chain assets, participate in token-weighted governance and more.

### Create your Research Collective

To create a Research Collective, the following steps need to be followed:

1. Creating Initial Research Engrams

* The individuals focusing on a specific research topic start by creating the first kEngrams of the research project. This can contain their existing research and knowledge.
* The researchers use the DeSciWorld protocols to submit their questions and answers on the platform.
* These kEngrams get validated through the Proof of Knowledge protocol and added to the DeSciWorld ecosystem.

2. Adding Research Engrams to the Collective

* Once the initial research engrams are created and validated, these engrams can be combined to create a Research Collective.
* This collective acts as a hub for researchers to combine their knowledge, compare notes, collaborate on shared topics of interest, and contribute to the body of research within that specific area.

3. Management and Expansion of a Research Collective

* The collective is overseen by its contributing researchers. Its expansion is facilitated by the addition of new kEngrams by both existing and new researchers.
* Researchers can join collectives that align with their interests or expertise, contributing their unique perspectives and research to the collectiveâ€™s knowledge base.
* Researchers can also leverage the resources provided by DeSciWorld, including collaborative tools, validation services, and communication platforms to enhance their research efforts.

### Monetization of Research through Proof of Knowledge

The PoK (Proof of Knowledge) mechanism rewards knowledge contributions within the DeSciWorld ecosystem. This applies to the research shared within Research Collectives.&#x20;

* As the kEngrams within a collective are used and referenced within DeSciWorld, the creators of these kEngrams receive KNOW tokens as rewards.
* This system incentivizes the creation and distribution of high-quality research, providing a revenue stream to researchers while enhancing the overall quality of Research Collectives.
