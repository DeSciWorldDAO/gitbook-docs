## 1. Introduction to P2P Funding Marketplace

Welcome to DeSciWorld's P2P Funding Marketplace - a unique platform connecting researchers and funders across the globe. Backed by blockchain technology, our marketplace allows for a secure and efficient funding process. By delivering continuous innovation, we aim to democratize the science funding landscape and provide novel opportunities for independent or anonymous funding of research projects.

## 2. Creating Your Research Profile

To start using our marketplace, you will first need to create a comprehensive research profile. Here's a step-by-step guide:

i. Click on 'Create Profile' on the P2P Funding Marketplace home page.

ii. Fill in the requested details, including your name, contact information, area of specialty, and experience.

iii. Highlight your research goals and objectives. Be clear and concise, ensuring potential funders understand your research direction.

To make your profile stand out, consider posting regular updates about your research and engage with the DeSciWorld community.

## 3. Using the Escrow and On-chain Reputation Mechanism

Our marketplace implements a secure blockchain-based escrow system for transactions and an on-chain reputation mechanism to build credibility. Whenever a funder supports your proposal, the funds are held in the escrow account and released as per your agreement's terms. Over time, as you complete projects successfully, your reputation score within the platform will increase, making you a more attractive candidate for funding.

## 4. Submitting Research Objectives

With your profile live, it's time to submit your research objectives. Navigate to 'Submit Research Objective', fill in the details of your proposal, and click 'Submit'. Remember to provide enough details for funders to grasp the essence, value proposition, and feasibility of your projects.

## 5. Proposal of Funding Requests

To request funding, go to 'Propose Funding Request,' fill in your project's details, including costs, timelines, and expected outcomes, then submit. Each funding proposal needs to be articulate, realistic, and should demonstrate high potential for scientific advancement.

## 6. Navigating through Fee Structures

A fee is incurred on the total value of funding received, ranging from 1-5%. Make sure to account for this while proposing your funding request.

## 7. Receiving Funds and Transparency

Once your proposal is backed, the funds are transferred from the escrow account as per the agreed terms. All transactions are visible on the blockchain, ensuring transparency in the process.

## 8. Best Practices and Tips

For success in securing funding, communication is key. Regular updates on your research progress can help maintain an engaged community of supporters. Be sure to respond promptly to inquiries or comments from potential or existing funders.

## 9. Customer Support and Helpful Resources
