# Governing DSW DAO

Whilst created outside of the DeSciWorld DAO’s jurisdiction, Microbes sales have been used by the Founding Team to fund operations in the bootstrapping phase of DeSciWorld’s growth. Thus, Microbes NFT holders are currently qualified to receive the following privileges:

* <mark style="color:blue;">**Redistribution lottery events:**</mark> DeSciWorld intends to accumulate digital assets from the DeSci and greater Web3 ecosystem for periodical redistribution to Microbes holders via lottery-style raffles.
* <mark style="color:blue;">**NFT Launchpad preferential access:**</mark> Microbe NFT holders are rewarded with privileges on our NFT Launchpad platform such as potential presale positions and gallery curator decisions.
* <mark style="color:blue;">**Unlockable content:**</mark> Certain Microbes NFTs contain unlockable content such as additional research data, reports, and even raw image files. The content is hosted on IPFS and made available through our website, secured through Web3 wallet integration. This unlockable content serves to enhance the artistic value of the Microbes NFTs.
* <mark style="color:blue;">**Experimental implementations:**</mark> Creative mechanics such as lock-ups, burns and staking may also be employed to bring the worlds of DeFi and DeSci together.
* <mark style="color:blue;">**Access to special events/areas:**</mark> VIP chat, special events at DeSci conferences, an airdrop, or merch distribution, the Microbes NFT will serve as the universal access pass.
