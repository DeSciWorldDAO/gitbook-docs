# “Early Adopter” rights

Ethereum wallet addresses that mint a Microbes NFT before the official launch of the DeSciWorld token ($DSCI) will be recognized within the DeSciWorld community as an “Early Adopter”.

Early Adopter roles belong to the specific wallet addresses that mint Microbes and may receive additional benefits such as preferential access to initiatives to be confirmed by the DeSciWorld DAO.
